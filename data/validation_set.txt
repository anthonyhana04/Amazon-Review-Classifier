"670|Great back support and sturdy. I've used many back supports over the past 20 years this one is very excellent. It fills well and deflates well and it rolls up to a small size, all excellent features. I would have given this product 5 stars but I would prefer a choice of colors and I also don't like the shape that much. It's a dogbone shape and I would prefer  the opposite with more support in the center of the back and a little less width. I have bought three of these in the past year because I like them so much. Also, the McKenzie back support (also very good) has similar limitations in color choice and shape. IF I could give this 4.5 stars I would but just holding back a little for color and shape."|Product Quality

"798|This bottle certainly makes hydration more exciting! I mostly drink plain water and it does get boring after a while, so when I saw this product I just had to try it. It makes it easy to add a variety of flavors to your water - the good all-natural way. The bottle itself is very well made, seems sturdy and it arrived well packaged, with no funky smells (a great plus!). I fill the infusing container in the morning and refill it with water multiple times during the day. I usually use cucumbers plus some fragrant like fresh mint leaves, basil or slices of ginger. I haven't tried it with fruit yet but I'm sure it would be delicious. I have received this product at a discounted price in exchange for my honest review, and I warmly recommend it.

"356|I have pretty severe Sjogren's Syndrome (dry eyes, nose, and mouth), and I have tried EVERYTHING.... It also doesn't help that I live in MI where the winter climates are cold & extremely dry. Every other product I have so far tried, either doesn't work at all or if it works, it only helps for about 5-10 minutes and then I have to re-apply. This product isn't a miracle, but out of everything I've tried, it seems to work the best. I especially have trouble wearing my contacts because my eyes are so dry, and this helps prolong my wear time (not by much, but I can at least sit through a movie now). Although a strange feeling that goes against every natural human reaction, I spray this onto open eyes. The directions say that it isn't necessary and that the product will still work if you close your eyes, but it lasts longer for me if I spray onto open eyes. I will definitely re-purchase this. And while this can easily fit in your purse, I do wish they'd make an even smaller one (like pocket size)."|Usability

It was a tad difficult to get open in the wind, but with patience and some sly maneuvers I had it up and locked in in just a few more minutes than usual.

"473|I love this machine! and the matching dryer too!<br /><br />Ok to set the record straight. About 4 years ago I fell for the &#34;all about being green front loader&#34;.  I bought an LG Front loader...It has been one of the most miserable 4 years of doing laundry imaginable. I would have never expected such an absolute nightmare. My laundry room has been stacked sky high with clothes that stink so bad that I would have to re-wash them four or five times until they were even wearable. I tried everything, I called the manufacture and begged for guidance! After multiple washings, I would resort to filling the bathtub and soaking all of the dark clothes. I even turned to using bleach - which I haven't used in decades. I couldn't take it anymore. I bought the Speed Queen AYN412 and the matching Dryer. I couldn't be happier with my new SPEED QUEEN I LOVE IT!. I would highly recommend this product.<br /><br />I received my new Speed Queen Washer and Dryer four days ago. It is fantastic! Yes... It looks and acts old-school. (It is true that my neighbor did kind of snicker when she saw it and even more when I told her how happy I was about my new Washer and Dryer) But I love this washer and dryer set. The clothes come out clean smelling and the towels are so fluffy! They look and feel like they have been actually washed. I know right? Imagine that! The clothes come out of the dryer warm and mostly wrinkle free. I can put in as many clothes in this machine as my old LG Front loader with no problem.  I have washed 16 loads of wash in 4 days. I have washed everything from white towels to washable delicate silk and even pantyhose.... Every load - Perfect every time! AND you might want to sit down for this... It takes 50 minutes to wash AND dry a load of laundry. Yep this working mom is very happy about that.  GOODBYE crappy - beat the heck out of the my clothes LG Front loader... Goodbye Forever - we are never never ever getting back together..... P.S. ... As far as the water savings... are you kidding? one load being washed five times only to be sent to a full bathtub doesn't look like any kind of savings to me.vings... are you kidding? one load being washed five times only to be sent to a full bathtub doesn't look like any kind of savings to me."|Product Quality

"649|I purchased this bag partly based on other reviews, and I must say I am SOOOOO happy that I did!  This bag is fabulous.  I was looking for something that was not the standard, boring black messenger bag, and this is it!  My laptop fits perfectly - it's a Dell 14&#34;.  I was a bit concerned that one reviewer said that he/she had to slice open the laptop sleeve to get the laptop to fit, but my 14&#34; (with extended battery) fits just fine.  This bag is - in the Goldilocks sense - not too big, not too small, but just right.  It is well-designed, with lots of pockets.  It has a strap across the back that I ended up removing because I don't need it (if you ride a bike with the bag, I guess it would be helpful).  The bag is not black, but more like a charcoal color, if that makes a difference.  It can fit a water bottle, but that takes up some of the internal space because of the way the pocket is designed.  This is not a flaw, but something to note if you carry a water bottle and also want to pack more than a laptop and a few folders or a binder.  If you need to carry more than a laptop and maybe one binder or textbook, you will need a bigger bag, but if you're looking for a stylish way to transport your laptop plus a binder or book, this bag is AWESOME.  Super sturdy, well designed, cool pattern, good padding on the laptop sleeve, and some reflective trim for safety, without looking too &#34;sporty&#34;."|Aesthetic Appeal

"354|These bands have done wonders for the pain in my husbands knees! The very first time he used them he walked all day without pain- in fact he forgot they were even on!

No bulk under his clothing either. Great great product!  Neoprene material- quality construction.

"694|This headlamp certainly does what I need it to.  I work on wind turbines for a living, and the low setting is great for most times when I need light in a dark area/cabinet/junction box, etc. The dial is much easier and faster to operate than a push button, especially when wearing gloves.  It also comes with a clip that's compatible with Petzl hard hats (which we use), so there's no need to buy an extra headband (or headlamp for that matter).  I can slide this one off my hard hat and onto the soft headband that came with it and get right to work. After pivoting, the light stays secure in that position, and it's ruggedly built. If you use it frequently, it does have a tendency to eat batteries - energizer ultimate lithiums lasted about 2.5 - 3 days of almost continual use.  Other than that, I'm loving this headlamp."|Usability

"73|So, I wouldn't have purchased this if it were not for my wife, who is infinitely frustrated with my audio setup.<br /><br />I needed something that would sit next to our TV, and be simple to use.  The fact that this has a remote is a nice bonus.  The fact that this can grab my local radio stations is a HUGE bonus - one which I didn't know it could do (does it via streaming).<br /><br />My problem is that I have this setup:<br /><br />Computer requests audio to be played from a Linux computer which uses a M2Tech Hiface to stream digital to my DAC (streamed lossless FLAC).  This then feeds into my preamp, and then amp and speakers.  To access the linux computer that runs the whole show, I have to have her use shell login to my linux host (not easy for most people, and if something goes wrong, she can't fix it).  You can then  from command line play pandora or music.<br /><br />So, those issues being stated, after plenty of research, I chose this.  I can connect this up right into my preamp, and she can use it pretty easily.  The setup was a snap, follow a few instructions, and I'm now linked up with my pandora account (I've got probably 40 stations I've been grooming for years).  Great.<br /><br />I had mistook the &#34;antenna&#34; in the product pictures for a coax hookup for an AM/FM antenna.  In fact this hookup is for the antenna to your wireless router.  Very fortunately, this nice box has the great feature of being able to pickup any radio station that streams their broadcasts (which as it turns out, is almost all of the local stations).  Not only that, but I can get stations that I would otherwise not be able to get at all (since I don't rely on an antenna, just whatever I choose to stream).  how do I get my local stations?  Simple !  you just set your location (enter your city I believe).  And it'll select the right stations for where you are.  It will also allow you to then progress outwards and grab more stations that you wouldn't otherwise be able to get with an antenna of probably any size.  I live in Baltimore, and it allows me to get stations hundreds of miles away!  Very slick!!<br /><br />The one downside to this product is that the built-in amplifier is really pretty poor quality.  However, I didn't buy this for that functionality anyway.  I only ended up using it, as my preamp crapped out, and I'm stuck using the built in amp for the time being.  It's nice that it's available, but don't think that if you have decent speakers, that you'll get very good sound quality.  You're much better off using the 'line out' and putting this into your favorite receiver or preamp, as the built in one just isn't so great, but it's functional.ith an antenna of probably any size.

Being NiCad batteries, you don't want them to go dead before recharging--and mine only had a small charge left in them, when they arrived.

The CR2016 batteries last a long time (if your remember to turn the light off when you're not using it, which some of my grandchildren don't) but they are a bit of a bother to replace, and they are hard to find in retail stores.

When I began using this at only a teaspoon per day in water (it is pleasant) it only  took about a week or so and I have been sleeping ever since - every night.  So very thankful for that neighbor's suggestion.  I am passing on the word to others  who cannot sleep."|Usability

"626|I really like the packaging of these microfiber towels. Each pouch (2) have a drawstring to close it. There's a small cloth for wiping sweat, and a larger towel to do yoga on. The larger mat is non- slip, and when wet it dries very quickly. I like to have wash these abs let them air dry. The pink is really pretty.  The material is kind-of thinner then I thought. But it still gets the job done. Also getting the towels back in the pouch wasnt easy . I had to refold them a few times to get it to fit. But overall I'm happy with this purchase. I received this product at a discounted price in exchange for my honest review."|Aesthetic Appeal

"768|I hang my kayak under my deck using these wall cradles. I would recommend also buying some tie down straps as my kayak was blown off the cradles by some strong wind and took some damage while stored. Now I strap around the deck post and kayak and it sits nicely in the cradles."|Usability

"754|Nalgene bottles are the tank of the bottle world. My previous bottle lasted through hundreds of liters of water and survived countless drops and falls. The thing that finally did in my previous bottle was being ran over by a F150, so I can't really fault the bottle on that one."|Usability
"378|I'm not one to believe hype but I thought I'd give this product a try in preparation for the birth of my first child.<br /><br />Now I am currently 19 days postpartum, I delivered a 8lb baby boy via the help of a forcep delivery. I had several tears that were 2nd degree tears including a brutal episiotomy and severe hemorrhoids. My body was battered and bruised after 36hrs in labor and 4 hrs of pushing. I remember two days after coming home from the hospital and just crying in the shower because I had severe PTSD from L&D and also I was so wrecked in my most sensitive area that I was in constant pain.<br /><br />My care routine consisted of witch hazel diluted with water in my peribottle that I stole from the hospital (it really was my best friend after I would use the bathroom) but right next up the peribottle was this new mama bottom spray. After I would clean up with the peribottle I would spray this on and although I was so numb and swollen down there that I couldn't feel much of a cooling sensation. I loved the smell and the idea that it was helping me heal.<br /><br />More than two weeks postpartum I'm back in my feet and still using this spray which is in fact very cooling and very refreshing. I still have a long way to go in recovering down there, but this product has helped so far :)  I would gladly recommend it to any new moms out there recovering from child birth."|Product Quality

"627|When I first bought these I was worried about the 1 star rating a saying that the pedals started creaking when relatively new. I bought them anyway and am glad that I did. After about 100 of road use one of the pedals did start to creak. All I had to do to fix it we take the axles out and make sure that the bearings were adjusted properly and repacked them with grease. I love these pedals. The only reason I didn't give them 5 stars was that I had to fiddle with them when they were basically new."|Product Quality
