"249|I have complex regional pain syndrome and I now move from my bed to my chair every day. I was putting my daily pills when I moved to the chair in a pill container lid, however the cat knocked them over one time too many.  My friend told me about these type of pill containers so I searched and found exactly what I needed and not a moment too soon. Shortly after my 2 weeks supply arrived and I filled them, I fell ill and there was no way I would have been able to have filled the next week of pills. I'm so thankful I had that 2nd week already filled. This has worked out perfectly for me - the crazy cat can't spill them, I can carry them wherever I need to. I take a lot of vitamins and supplements and they ALL fit!!!"
"778|This is by far one of the best products I have ever had. I would say that I use this beach tent in our yard on a daily basis for afternoon fun in the sun. Yesterday we had some serious winds and it did bend a bit, but that is because I forgot to tie the cords at the top. It was a tad difficult to get open in the wind, but with patience and some sly maneuvers I had it up and locked in in just a few more minutes than usual. It is important to always use the stakes or sandbags to keep the tent from blowing over. All in all I really like this product, and I love their customer service people just as much. Great product!"
"533|fan can run loud. But man... It's nice, does its job and was very easy to install."
"938|Well not work with my torch"
"585|Been nearly a year since we got this and we still love it.  Keeps everything the perfect temp.<br />Bottom row works great for larger bottles.<br />Wish it had a place you could store one sitting up if you don't finish and need to reseal<br />Can't beat the price."

"905|Can drill about 4 small holes and battery dies.  I don't have another working battery or battery charger currently to 100% troubleshoot the symptoms (which is why I gave 2 stars instead of one); however, after multiple times charging the battery, I consistently get about 60 seconds of operation before the battery dies again.  Would not buy again."
"94|Works great!"
"243|This 2 in 1 Scalpicin is great.  Will buy again.,"
"473|I love this machine! and the matching dryer too!<br /><br />Ok to set the record straight. About 4 years ago I fell for the &#34;all about being green front loader&#34;.  I bought an LG Front loader...It has been one of the most miserable 4 years of doing laundry imaginable. I would have never expected such an absolute nightmare. My laundry room has been stacked sky high with clothes that stink so bad that I would have to re-wash them four or five times until they were even wearable. I tried everything, I called the manufacture and begged for guidance! After multiple washings, I would resort to filling the bathtub and soaking all of the dark clothes. I even turned to using bleach - which I haven't used in decades. I couldn't take it anymore. I bought the Speed Queen AYN412 and the matching Dryer. I couldn't be happier with my new SPEED QUEEN I LOVE IT!. I would highly recommend this product.<br /><br />I received my new Speed Queen Washer and Dryer four days ago. It is fantastic! Yes... It looks and acts old-school. (It is true that my neighbor did kind of snicker when she saw it and even more when I told her how happy I was about my new Washer and Dryer) But I love this washer and dryer set. The clothes come out clean smelling and the towels are so fluffy! They look and feel like they have been actually washed. I know right? Imagine that! The clothes come out of the dryer warm and mostly wrinkle free. I can put in as many clothes in this machine as my old LG Front loader with no problem.  I have washed 16 loads of wash in 4 days. I have washed everything from white towels to washable delicate silk and even pantyhose.... Every load - Perfect every time! AND you might want to sit down for this... It takes 50 minutes to wash AND dry a load of laundry. Yep this working mom is very happy about that.  GOODBYE crappy - beat the heck out of the my clothes LG Front loader... Goodbye Forever - we are never never ever getting back together..... P.S. ... As far as the water savings... are you kidding? one load being washed five times only to be sent to a full bathtub doesn't look like any kind of savings to me.vings... are you kidding? one load being washed five times only to be sent to a full bathtub doesn't look like any kind of savings to me."
"568|TRIED TO SAVE $20, ENDED UP WITH A WATER LEAK & DAMAGE TO MY FINISHED BASEMENT CEILING.  NOW I HAVE TO DO DRI WALL REPAIR....  DO NOT BUY THIS !!!!"
"980|I put this on my Rugar Ar 556 , excellent mount and well made , very brite light and great price , recommended !"
"110|It works! I got a muscle cramp, rub it on the area nd the pain was gone within a minute."
"785|Convenient, great lighting. Will order more of this product."
"53|Love this radio. It alerts the whole family when any form of weather changes. Plus you can have one in each room."
"834|Works as expected. Some times the locking screw backs off and the adaptor comes off with the pole."
"133|You won't be disappointed. The only draw back is that you can't change out batteries"
"427|The dryer for this stackable unit destroys clothes.  A loose button is found almost every time buttoned up shirts go in the dryer.  The vent holes to the lint trap are very large, and just the right size for buttons to be lodge in to be ripped off.  I have had buttons destroyed and holes ripped open when the buttons get ripped off.  All they need to do is design a replacement piece and I will get to keep my buttons."
"554|Bever worked! Tried replacement twice and still did not do the trick! Beware of this product!"
"649|I purchased this bag partly based on other reviews, and I must say I am SOOOOO happy that I did!  This bag is fabulous.  I was looking for something that was not the standard, boring black messenger bag, and this is it!  My laptop fits perfectly - it's a Dell 14&#34;.  I was a bit concerned that one reviewer said that he/she had to slice open the laptop sleeve to get the laptop to fit, but my 14&#34; (with extended battery) fits just fine.  This bag is - in the Goldilocks sense - not too big, not too small, but just right.  It is well-designed, with lots of pockets.  It has a strap across the back that I ended up removing because I don't need it (if you ride a bike with the bag, I guess it would be helpful).  The bag is not black, but more like a charcoal color, if that makes a difference.  It can fit a water bottle, but that takes up some of the internal space because of the way the pocket is designed.  This is not a flaw, but something to note if you carry a water bottle and also want to pack more than a laptop and a few folders or a binder.  If you need to carry more than a laptop and maybe one binder or textbook, you will need a bigger bag, but if you're looking for a stylish way to transport your laptop plus a binder or book, this bag is AWESOME.  Super sturdy, well designed, cool pattern, good padding on the laptop sleeve, and some reflective trim for safety, without looking too &#34;sporty&#34;."
"81|Good for the price."
"354|These bands have done wonders for the pain in my husbands knees! The very first time he used them he walked all day without pain- in fact he forgot they were even on! The next day he forgot to put them on and his knees hurt like crazy! They are padded for comfort and have dual Velcro straps for easy and correct tightening without pinching.  He wears, as you can see in the pictures, them below his knees but since they are so adjustable I'm sure they'd work in the area of choice. Perfect size and thickness. Not hot or sweaty. No bulk under his clothing either. Great great product!  Neoprene material- quality construction. Received in exchange for my honest review   Ok so my husband has been wearing these every day and he reported that they WORK!! So much less pain- don't not know why or how but the do. In days he forgets or try's to go without them he can barely walk at the end of the day!! He's had 4 back surgeries and has constant pain down both legs, hip and knees-- these are awesome! I'll be getting more for back up!! Great great item !"
"253|It is amaizing. Took a little while to get here but It is worth It"
"694|This headlamp certainly does what I need it to.  I work on wind turbines for a living, and the low setting is great for most times when I need light in a dark area/cabinet/junction box, etc. The dial is much easier and faster to operate than a push button, especially when wearing gloves.  It also comes with a clip that's compatible with Petzl hard hats (which we use), so there's no need to buy an extra headband (or headlamp for that matter).  I can slide this one off my hard hat and onto the soft headband that came with it and get right to work. After pivoting, the light stays secure in that position, and it's ruggedly built. If you use it frequently, it does have a tendency to eat batteries - energizer ultimate lithiums lasted about 2.5 - 3 days of almost continual use.  Other than that, I'm loving this headlamp."
"180|Fairly sturdy, all metal construction, it did come with wall anchors, screws & straps to secure it upright if you need to do so. No missing parts, and the fit & finish are very good. Instructions are very basic, but it's easy tool free assembly means a 1 sheet instruction page is fine.<br /><br />As the shelves are adjustable to wherever you want them to go, you may have extra shelves leftover depending on how and where you place them on the poles.  As I migrate my DVD collection to Blu-Ray, I'll shrink the space between shelves and add the extras later.<br /><br />Overall, very pleased with this product at this price point."
"247|Best wipes ever, have tried many brands but pampers hands-down are the best"
"447|Nice unit, however, only works with what I would say is standard slim wine bottles. Any bottle that is odd size will not fit on the racks.  So, to use the fridge for varying size wine bottles you would have to remove some shelves to allow them to fit which reduces the capacity.  I'm sending mine back, which has not been a problem so far working with Amazon."
"73|So, I wouldn't have purchased this if it were not for my wife, who is infinitely frustrated with my audio setup.<br /><br />I needed something that would sit next to our TV, and be simple to use.  The fact that this has a remote is a nice bonus.  The fact that this can grab my local radio stations is a HUGE bonus - one which I didn't know it could do (does it via streaming).<br /><br />My problem is that I have this setup:<br /><br />Computer requests audio to be played from a Linux computer which uses a M2Tech Hiface to stream digital to my DAC (streamed lossless FLAC).  This then feeds into my preamp, and then amp and speakers.  To access the linux computer that runs the whole show, I have to have her use shell login to my linux host (not easy for most people, and if something goes wrong, she can't fix it).  You can then  from command line play pandora or music.<br /><br />So, those issues being stated, after plenty of research, I chose this.  I can connect this up right into my preamp, and she can use it pretty easily.  The setup was a snap, follow a few instructions, and I'm now linked up with my pandora account (I've got probably 40 stations I've been grooming for years).  Great.<br /><br />I had mistook the &#34;antenna&#34; in the product pictures for a coax hookup for an AM/FM antenna.  In fact this hookup is for the antenna to your wireless router.  Very fortunately, this nice box has the great feature of being able to pickup any radio station that streams their broadcasts (which as it turns out, is almost all of the local stations).  Not only that, but I can get stations that I would otherwise not be able to get at all (since I don't rely on an antenna, just whatever I choose to stream).  how do I get my local stations?  Simple !  you just set your location (enter your city I believe).  And it'll select the right stations for where you are.  It will also allow you to then progress outwards and grab more stations that you wouldn't otherwise be able to get with an antenna of probably any size.  I live in Baltimore, and it allows me to get stations hundreds of miles away!  Very slick!!<br /><br />The one downside to this product is that the built-in amplifier is really pretty poor quality.  However, I didn't buy this for that functionality anyway.  I only ended up using it, as my preamp crapped out, and I'm stuck using the built in amp for the time being.  It's nice that it's available, but don't think that if you have decent speakers, that you'll get very good sound quality.  You're much better off using the 'line out' and putting this into your favorite receiver or preamp, as the built in one just isn't so great, but it's functional.ith an antenna of probably any size.

"954|The real deal DeWalt batteries! If you need these, you may want to get them soon. Being NiCad batteries, you don't want them to go dead before recharging--and mine only had a small charge left in them, when they arrived. Probably remaining old stock (everything is going Li-Ion nowadays,) so it'll soon get to the point that any original DeWalt batteries you get, of this type, may have discharged completely in storage. Then the only fresh battery packs available will be the aftermarket manufacturer's."
"653|These little flashlights are great.  I actually have three of them: one for my keychain, one in my toolbox, and one I carry on my very-early-morning constitutional (my little finger fits perfectly into its ring).  I also gave one to each of my 12 grandchildren (ages 5 to  22)  for Xmas last year, though one was immediately stolen by his father.  The CR2016 batteries last a long time (if your remember to turn the light off when you're not using it, which some of my grandchildren don't) but they are a bit of a bother to replace, and they are hard to find in retail stores.  You might  want to buy the  pack of spares along with your light."
"639|We have two of these.  One went for a swim in a river.  We bought another one.  My son drinks a lot of water so he carries one of these with him every day all day.  Well, I carry it.  He drinks out of it. Just be careful if they sleep with it, know that it does leak.  All.  Night.  Long."
"49|Horrible"
"273|This  product I have used for the past 2 years when a neighbor suggested it for a 27 year old problem I had with RLS.  I hadn't slept but 1 - 2 hours a night at least 5 nights a week and then would sleep heavily  and restlessly for 2 nights.  It sure wore me  down.  When I began using this at only a teaspoon per day in water (it is pleasant) it only  took about a week or so and I have been sleeping ever since - every night.  So very thankful for that neighbor's suggestion.  I am passing on the word to others  who cannot sleep."
"239|Great cane.  I have small hands and very arthritic, but it is very comfortable."
"310|Great product! This supplement is given to Cancer patients in large doses in the UK. It actually helps reduce your risk of Cancer in the body, along with other health products.  I take 1 pill on empty stomach every morning...do your research on this supplement & you will see why doctors use it in the UK for patients with Cancer...but make sure you are buying from reputable dealer..."

"305|I was a little skeptical that a cream would actually aid in losing weight, but my skin looks and feels firmer. The cream is super hydrating and keeps my skin soft all day. It smells fresh and clean too. I am looking forward to seeing more results over time!"
"853|Bought my box from Jaxvapesupply, was delivered in a timely manner, customer service when contacting the seller was great.<br /><br />If anyone is on the fence about buying this, I would recommend it over and again, build quality on mine is good, everything works, just remember you have to buy batteries ( I would recommend samsung 18650's )"
"578|This works great! It has prevented the &#34;Oops&#34; of putting dirty into clean dishes."
"105|The turntable do not work correctly.  It was dragging!  Otherwise, the sound and other features worked well!!"
"380|Extremely smooth shave and love the trim blade.  Makes it much easier and cleaner to trim the goatee and mustache. A great combo."
"491|We have an older Samsung and the turn table plate finally cracked and broke. This replacement is the perfect fit and though pricey, it is worth it. Now the food goes round and round again when we cook in the microwave."
"294|Great product"
"626|I really like the packaging of these microfiber towels. Each pouch (2) have a drawstring to close it. There's a small cloth for wiping sweat, and a larger towel to do yoga on. The larger mat is non- slip, and when wet it dries very quickly. I like to have wash these abs let them air dry. The pink is really pretty.  The material is kind-of thinner then I thought. But it still gets the job done. Also getting the towels back in the pouch wasnt easy . I had to refold them a few times to get it to fit. But overall I'm happy with this purchase. I received this product at a discounted price in exchange for my honest review."
"338|I did not realize when I bought this that the amount of product in it is actually quite small and you can see from the color of the capsule that it is primarily rice flour."

"768|I hang my kayak under my deck using these wall cradles. I would recommend also buying some tie down straps as my kayak was blown off the cradles by some strong wind and took some damage while stored. Now I strap around the deck post and kayak and it sits nicely in the cradles."
"738|This set is a wonderful tool addition to my tool kit. I use this set every day sense I got. Just always good for on the go repairs. I used to use my leatherman multi tool for everything but now I find myself using this set more. Highly recommend this jewelers screw driver set."
"207|It still is itching like always. maybe a little less but it didn't fix any long term problem. Just sooth a little bit."
"538|We bought this microwave 2 years ago as part of a home remodel. It was great while it worked but recently stopped working. Sharp warranty is only 1 year. For the amount of money we spent on this I would expect it to last more than 2 years."
"385|They did not due well for me caused stomach pains and diarrhea"
"80|Exactly as described. The sleeves have helped to &#34;tidy up&#34; by work space. Thanks!"
"754|Nalgene bottles are the tank of the bottle world. My previous bottle lasted through hundreds of liters of water and survived countless drops and falls. The thing that finally did in my previous bottle was being ran over by a F150, so I can't really fault the bottle on that one."
"378|I'm not one to believe hype but I thought I'd give this product a try in preparation for the birth of my first child.<br /><br />Now I am currently 19 days postpartum, I delivered a 8lb baby boy via the help of a forcep delivery. I had several tears that were 2nd degree tears including a brutal episiotomy and severe hemorrhoids. My body was battered and bruised after 36hrs in labor and 4 hrs of pushing. I remember two days after coming home from the hospital and just crying in the shower because I had severe PTSD from L&D and also I was so wrecked in my most sensitive area that I was in constant pain.<br /><br />My care routine consisted of witch hazel diluted with water in my peribottle that I stole from the hospital (it really was my best friend after I would use the bathroom) but right next up the peribottle was this new mama bottom spray. After I would clean up with the peribottle I would spray this on and although I was so numb and swollen down there that I couldn't feel much of a cooling sensation. I loved the smell and the idea that it was helping me heal.<br /><br />More than two weeks postpartum I'm back in my feet and still using this spray which is in fact very cooling and very refreshing. I still have a long way to go in recovering down there, but this product has helped so far :)  I would gladly recommend it to any new moms out there recovering from child birth."
"426|This is so very AWESOME!!!!!  Love it!!!!"
"138|Trash, returned mine after 2 days. The pads are hard and very uncomfortable. It is completely plastic  and feels like it is  about to break. DONT BUY"
"627|When I first bought these I was worried about the 1 star rating a saying that the pedals started creaking when relatively new. I bought them anyway and am glad that I did. After about 100 of road use one of the pedals did start to creak. All I had to do to fix it we take the axles out and make sure that the bearings were adjusted properly and repacked them with grease. I love these pedals. The only reason I didn't give them 5 stars was that I had to fiddle with them when they were basically new."

"246|This product does everything that it says it will do and more. I have experienced significant improvement everytime I use it. The only drawback is the price.

"47|Hard to beat the price. They all seem to work the same and be the same quality, why pay more?"
"34|Good looking over the ear headphones that have a surprising deep bass response. I have noticed new bass notes on some of the songs I have been listening to for years. I use them at work to reduce the surrounding noise. A great value."
"234|This stuff is great. I take two a day and on capsule lasts twelve hours. I took a second one too close the previous capsule and I felt a little light-headed for a few hours. Take 12 hours apart and they dropped my blood pressure 10 to 15 points for almost the whole time.<br /><br />Of course Amazon's shipping and pricing can't be beat."
"705|It's a excellent bottle. At the first uses (5 at least) the water tastes horrible (I think due to the long time of storage and/or the excess of filter products). However, after these uses the water tastes good and you forget that you are using a filter. I recommend!"

"580|I have a frigidaire fgus2632lp which I believe this model replaced.  Mine is also a piece of junk.  Icemaker had 3 service calls in first 3 months.  I assumed the water dispenser put out chilled water but it doesn't, which sales people didn't even mention. Fridge interior cannot maintain constant temp; items toward rear(like pickles in a jar) have gotten frozen.  Items come out of fridge damp, and shelves are damp.  I will never buy any frigidaire product again.  I have bought another 2 years extended warranty(my fridge is 4 years old) and when it runs out I am replacing this piece of crap."
"403|Love my refrigerator! ! Keeps everything  cold..will recommend!"
"691|I have used this camping a few times now and it does a decent job of producing light for our tent.  I suggest reading all the specs as this is much smaller than I anticipated.  I bought one of the old version too and this is brighter (non-scientific based on trying to read using each to measure light).  You would not want to rely on this for camp site light.  For what you get and the price this is okay and I'm happy with my purchase 3.5 stars."
"494|Really love this microwave. Has the one touch settings that I wanted along with the +30 seconds button.  Its a great size for a countertop.  It can be a little noisy when it beeps as others have said."
"881|Wish I had bought one sooner. Well worth the money, thank you guyz."
"510|Outstanding looks cool."
"846|Product is good, but expensive."
"680|Great product and easy to install.  Purchased for our son who started working beach lifeguard this summer and needed a bike to get around the boardwalk/ocean front.  Rack can be stored easily when not in use and can be installed in minutes.  I needed another rack to carry my bike and my wife's bike (our son is constantly using his) and went right back to Saris and purchased another!"
"985|Part was missing. falls over even when empty. Pay more, get better quality."
"291|Great product....delivered quickly"
"480|Great deal aaaa+"
"843|Uncomfortable around nose bridge. Cheap foam coverings. Wide vents that can let all sorts of dust in. I have no clue why this is rated so highly."
"443|works great!!!!!!"
"894|Batteries perform perfectly for the few months I've had them."
"673|Clean, kept a warm and a cold and storong!<br />I love it! I don't like a plastic bottles.<br />I recommend this instead buying plastic ones."
"449|Keep everything at 55 degrees, and don't overstress it and it works great- after the first 4 weeks so we'll see."
"780|Great fit, lightweight, and keeps the bugs away."
"333|Love these pills for stress"
"646|Good bike, but the oddly shaped frame is not friendly to car carriers.  Bike is also very heavy.  Other than those two things, it is nice."
"434|They claim that it holds 52 bottles.  i could barely squeeze in about 47 and these were at a tightness to where i was concerned that i would break the wood drawers."

"891|Old...rock hard. Absolutely useless junk. crumbles to bits"
"280|Good product. We have noticed a significant difference in the motion of knees and ankles. Motion is a whole lot better and pain significantly less since I purchased this product over a month ago. Just ordered 2nd time a couple of weeks ago."
"203|This is a good daily vitamin for men."
"226|PH Test strips :))"
"39|works as expected; well made cable."
"453|Yes, this was just what I needed to get the old washer humming again.  It did not fit the cabinet exactly, but I took a chunk of metal out of the back of the cabinet and it went in nice as pie,"
"281|I absolutely love this product. It has the best taste and most exciting flavors of all enhancers. Highly recommended."
"168|This thing kicks buttttt!"
"368|I previously gave this a mediocre review, because it seemed to give me a stomach ache when I made a carrot cake with it. I continued to use it though in smaller amounts. I haven't had the problem since, and it may just be that I at way too much all at once (frosting, etc.), or else it was the combined ingredients of the cake I ate. I love this stuff. It's so much like sugar and even has the mouth-feel of sugar. I always feel like I'm cheating when I eat it, but I don't get any weight gain or blood sugar surges. I love stevia too, but it's only good in certain things. Swerve is great in everything. I've served it to people without telling them it wasn't sugar, and no one knew the difference. About to order more now. Yum! :P<br /><br />PREVIOUS REVIEW:<br />Love the taste of this stuff, and it would probably be ok in small amounts, but after making a frosted carrot cake using Swerve, I found then it caused quite a bit of nausea. The feeling is similar to what it feels like when you eat way too much sugar. Yet when I tested my blood sugar, it hadn't gone up. Both my boyfriend and I experienced this on both occasions after eating a piece of cake made with this sweetener. The cake taste great, but I won't be buying this again."
"910|Wow - these things work! At least so far. Getting used to the screen in front of my eyes didn't take anytime...I really like these for most of the time I need safety glasses."
"849|Seems fine"
"847|very nice tape!! This was my comment right after I got the tape. After about 3 months of daily use it started to retract all of the time. I contacted Amazon to see if I could make an adjustment to fix it. They said that was not possible but would send me a new one. I thought that was great until the replacement had the same issues within a few months. Bottom line it appears these are not make very durable."
"446|Note that this only chills to a low of 51 degrees. I probably would have bought another model had I realized this as I like my white wine in the mid-40s. However it does function well, is a very nice looking refrigerator, and I don't find it to be too loud like some other reviewers (maybe that depends on the surface on where it sits.) Also note that it only fits slim bottles of wine - anything that is a bit larger in circumference on the bottom only fits in a few of the spaces."
"733|this nose plug does its job as i expected.  while swimming, i can breathe out, but not breathe in (water could not get into my nose, but i could blow air out of my nose, if i chose to).  i have two of these nose plugs, one for each of my two goggles, and have used these nose plugs ever since i bought them for daily swimming.  i rate this product five stars."
