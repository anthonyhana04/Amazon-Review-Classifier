The straw sticks up in the air, costing some aero energy, but you can stick some Velcro on the frame and around the straw and push it down. There's probably a less expensive solution to a BTA hydration system, but this is easy to install and convenient and lightweight."|Product Quality
"952|If you use this product on something that has lead paint on it, you will quickly see the swabbed area turn pink or red. You need to be able to test down through all layers of paint, so cutting some away with a knife to get to lower levels is helpful. If there is no lead, you will still see an orange color because the liquid in the product is orange.  Having the test sheet to see the expected color change for a positive result was helpful. There are directions for using the product on a red surface.<br /><br />I tried removing some lead paint with a liquid paint stripper. Retested the bare wood, and it still tested positive. Better to cover it up and seal it in."|Usability

"482|[[ASIN:B00JCG9H0W Electrolux EI24ID50QS Built-In Dishwasher with IQ Touch Controls, 24-Inch, Stainless Steel]] This has been disappointing, to say the least. We had the dishwasher professionally installed, and ran a test cycle. A little more than half way through the cycle, it beeped and gave an error message. I called customer service number and spent two hours in the circle of hell known as voicemail carousel, cut-off, call back, runaround, &#34;try this number instead,&#34; and so on. Finally got a repairman out, twice now, and it still has not run through a complete cycle without shutting down with an error message. It has now been 3 weeks since we bought it, and nearly 2 weeks since we had it installed, and we still do not have a working dishwasher. Update: After the backordered parts were installed, it immediately sprung another leak before finishing a load of dishes. More parts have been backordered. It has now been 46 days since I ordered this, and it has never run through a cycle. Electrolux has refused to refund, but Amazon is considering making an exception to their 30 day return policy since the backordered parts kept me waiting."|Product Quality

"495|Same as everyone else, NEVER buy Samsung major kitchen appliances. I spent over $5K a little over 5 yrs ago. Dishwasher died in 18m and had to be fully replaced, Bosch working great since the. Refrigerator ice maker died at 2yrs, replaced and 2nd one just died at 3yrs old last month. Now SMH9187 microwave, that worked okay at least for 5 yrs in very light use, just died with broken door latch (like dozens of others hit). Fixed it per YouTube video by drilling new hole in plastic door latch and moving spring. That worked fine but in middle of night 2 days before that, microwave beeped in middle of the night on its own, then had E-13 on the display.   Reset it and now getting either the dreaded SE error or worse, it literally in under 5 minutes suddenly turns on by ITSELF showing something about cooking a potato! Now after seeing hundreds of similar complaints including that microwave caused at least a couple fires I'm now scared to leave it plugged in when not home, especially since I have 3 pets. Going to replace with nice GE new one. Last GE microwave lasted over 12yrs!  Also had 2 Samsung LCD TV's, 1 BluRay and 1 DVD player all die in under 2yrs too.  NEVER, EVER GOING TO BUY ANYTHING FROM SAMSUNG AGAIN!!!  Shame on them for fooling me more than once but beyond shame on them for their utter lack of safety and concern for their customers!"|Product Quality

My man was a bit reluctant because ALL of the other flavored lube in our drawer tasted like metal and leave a funky after taste and feel sticky (total turn-off OUCH). After trying the Wicked brand - WE'RE SOLD! Not only is it tasty and non sticky, it wipes off easily, no artificial ingredients, and it lasts a long time. The bottle is sleek and discreet, and completely changed our view on flavored lube. It's so good that he threw our other lubes away. Do yourself a flavor (hee hee) and try the pom favor.

When I complained to our local Samsung appliance technician, he told me that Samsung has had 100's or 1,000's of complaints about this, but that Samsung is actually waiting for people to die before they care to do anything about this.<br />When I called Samsung's corporate &#34;Executive Relations&#34; office I spent over half an hour on hold, then an hour with a true idiot who provided zero assistance.

You have to hold the straw to the spray nozzle each time, which is difficult, and you will most likely need help with that part."|Usability

"332|Great carrier oil. I use it alone to massage my scalp and my boyfriend scalp. I use it on days where my scalp feels too dry/stripped. My boyfriend had horrendous dry scalp (snowflakes all over his shirt and in his hair :/). I massaged this and occasionally tea tree oil in his hair every night for a few days, and it really cleared his flakes up! The tea tree oil helped, but this alone would be fine. I read it jojoba oil/wax is one of the closest substrates to human sebum (which our skin and scalp produce that make it oily). Seems to work that way. His scalp is realllllly dry and his hair is so thick it just kinda lays there (he can go like...5 days without washing his hair). So I apply very liberally throughout his whole scalp. Seems to do the trick! He loves how it makes his hair more manageable and actually &#34;do something&#34; (his words).<br /><br />Really great moisturizer too. I think it'll come in handy in the cold, windy winters here where it is hard to retain moisture. I think it would feel wonderful warmed up and massaged into the scalp or body :)."|Product Quality

"445|I rarely do reviews, but wanted to let people know about the deceptive marketing on this dishwasher.  We did a remodel and due to space constraints needed an 18 inch dishwasher.  We replaced a Kenmore dishwasher rated at 50 db.  The Bosch sounds like a freight train in our kitchen compared to the Kenmore.  We couldn't tell the Kenmore was on, but with the Bosch we can't run it when we are home.  It drowns out the TV and forget about getting any sleep when it is running (the bedroom is on one side of the kitchen and the living room on the other).  Whoever rated this at 46 db must be hard of hearing.<br /><br />The plus side is that it has great features and cleans well.  The only other negative is that door doesn't let you prop it open.  I like to open it a couple inches after it is done to let the dishes dry thoroughly.  The Kenmore would stay in any partially open position, but the Bosch is basically full open or closed and there is no way to adjust the tension on the spring to operate the door."|Product Quality

"174|after a lightening strike wiped out my old receiver along with my music streaming devices (Grace and Roku) I was looking for an all in one 2 channel receiver that would stream internet radio, play Pandora type services and stream from my 400GB music database.  After researching on line, I bought this unit.<br /><br />It arrived today.  Set up was easy. It took longer un untangle the rats nest of old wires than to set up the new unit.  I connected my wired network and started to play around.  The sound quality is excellent!  The choices of inputs are excellent as well.  The one great shortcoming is the display panel.  I cannot understand why Yamaha would put 1980's technology into this otherwise modern, high quality system.  It has a one line 13 character dot matrix display for alpha numeric messages, such as track name, station id etc.  beyond me why they cut this corner.<br /><br />What saves the day is the app.  Yamaha NP Controller allows you to pretty much do everything from your android or iOS device.  The app is smooth, fast and intuitive.  Ps: do not download the Yamaha AV Controller App as it does not apply to this unit."|Product Quality

I use it only on camping and hunting trips to receive the Weather Service weather reports and as a backup for my Sangean AM/FM portable radio (love that one).

"84|[[VIDEOID:ca7421903fd1ad5c64ae1dc42a160649]] Earbuds have always been an issue for me. Mine is one of those stereotypical stories -- I can't find a pair that fits my ears well. I've tried so many types of earbuds and most of them give my ear canals some sort of fatigue. It's not that they sound bad, just that keeping them in my ears for more than 10 minutes is painful. The only ones I could tolerate were the Apple EarPods, and I have a love/hate relationship with them. Sure, they sit nicely in my ears, but them being fully open means I lose my music to the crickets of night and pelicans of day. Well, no more! I found the Flare R2A in-ear monitors, and seems my fear of earbuds is over.<br /><br />Disclaimer: This product was provided at a discounted price in exchange for an honest review.<br /><br />The R2s began their life on Kickstarter with a campaign that raised over $170,000. That's quite a lot for IEMs, which are a rather niche market. Flare is a British company that strives for excellence in sound, and hopes that the world can join them in this pursuit. Before the R2s, the company made loudspeakers, so in-ears is a bit of a different industry. I think they did a fine job of things.<br /><br />I listen to a lot of different genres of music, but mostly folk and dream pop lately. To test out the R2s, I listened to hip-hop, jazz, EDM, instrumental guitar and piano, rock, classical, and of course the aforementioned folk. They performed consistently well in every genre. They also look great.<br /><br />First, of course, the sound. These IEMs aren't active noise canceling or anything fancy, which is good because noise canceling often diminishes the sound quality. The R2s are still great for keeping outside noises to a minimum. They use the same plushy foam tips as earplugs, which makes for a comfortable and quiet listening environment. I tried them at work, in the bus, walking down a busy road, and even in a studio while recording. There's absolutely no sound leakage at all, which is great for quiet environments, and none of the quality seems to be lost when the environment is noisy.<br /><br />People sometimes rant about flat response and how it's better than everything else. Those people might be troubled by the R2s. They're warmer than most earbuds, but don't have muddy bass. The main issue with earbuds is always treble: there's way too much of it everywhere. Then Skullcandy wanted to have fun so they started adding a bunch of bass to the mix. Everything above 80Hz seemed to have been lost. The R2s have none of those problems -- highs are crisp, mids cut through well, and the lows of course deliver the much-needed punch, rather than a drone. The responsiveness of everything is very tight.<br /><br />As I said before, everything I listened to with these IEMs sounded wonderful. They revealed details in songs that I didn't know were there, while also being comfortable, affordable, and easy to use. The highs were not overbearing, but pronounced; the high-mids don't clutter the highs at all; the low-mids keep all the bass lines in check; and the lows make sure you remember that the bass drum exists without making you forget about the guitars in the mid-range. That's a great achievement. I really love the way these sound. Everything is balanced. Overall, it's a bit warm, but I would much rather it be warm than sound like tinny old Apple earbuds from the early 2000s, with their mesh and bass-less muddle.<br /><br />On to the design. These things are beautifully minimal, but aren't trying to be artistic, which is nice for a change. The earbuds themselves are black (or whatever color you chose), and the tips and cable match that. There's also a rectangular machined aluminum box that splits the stereo signal for the left and right channels. It doesn't need to be as big as it is, but it does add some pizzazz to things. Lastly, there's the 3.5mm connector, which on mine is black with two gold stripes running through it.<br /><br />I love the design, but there's one ergonomic inconsistency: The aluminum box. It looks cool, and I can see why the designer would have put it there. However, if you want to use these as a versatile pair of IEMs, you may walk with them once in a while, or just move around a bit. The latter is inevitable, and when you do choose to move around you'll hear some strange thudding sounds. That's the box attempting to defy gravity. Every time I hear this I tell myself it's cool to look at, but doesn't need to be so heavy and certainly doesn't add any special functionality. The heaviness, I suppose, adds value to the IEMs. I would just prefer it wasn't here, especially when I'm using these to perform.<br /><br />While these are \\""reference\\"" series -- at least according to the marketing by Flare -- I don't recommend using them for referencing. The R2s don't produce a completely flat sound like Sonys do. They're amazing for listening to, but not necessarily for studio work. I tried mixing a few song using them just for fun, and I noticed that most of my mixes tended to lose the low-mid range on other speakers and headphones simply because the R2s are warm. This characteristic is great when listening to music, but not for mixing/producing it.<br /><br />If you're a musician, you'll find that these are great for monitoring (and thus they are named in-ear monitors). I used them to monitor my vocals and piano while recording an entire song and they worked great. The warmth helps make things less straining on the ears, and there's not so much bass that I get a headache using them after a while. I also used these to monitor my synth and the rest of the band while playing live, and the foam tips isolated the sound very well.<br /><br />It's worth noting that since these are in-ear monitors, there is no microphone. The aluminum block in the middle of the cable just acts as a splitter -- there's no hidden microphone. At first this bugged me, because I would receive a call and forget I couldn't use these headphones to talk. After a while, I just accepted it. There's no reason for IEMs to have a microphone since there's no way for you to use it as a talkback to your band or anything. It also goes against the way that Flare built these, which is to solely focus on recreating sound accurately, not adding more sound. Bottom line: A microphone would have been useful, but there isn't one, and that shouldn't be a deal breaker.<br /><br />Here's the verdict: The R2s made me like earbuds again. I was considering the Shure SE215s, but these reign superior. Once they're in my ears, I don't feel like I need to take them out. They feel at home. Even Apple's EarPods, which \\""sit\\"" in my ears nicely, don't make me forget that I'm listening to music through small pieces of plastic in my ears. The R2s do, and they don't look ridiculous like some earbuds. My friend even told me he didn't notice I was wearing them because they're so small. That's awesome.e the design, but there's one ergonomic inconsistency: The aluminum box. It looks cool, and I can see why the designer would have put it there.

"676|Purchased this bike for my two year old son, who at the time of receiving the bike was approximately 32 inches tall.  The bike fit him perfectly with the seat post most of the way down, giving lots of room for growth.  We gave him this bike in March and I am not writing this review in August, so this review is with 5-6 months of experience with using the bike.<br /><br />The bike arrived in a relatively small box and assembly was done in 5-10 minutes.  Attached the handlebars and seat post, tighten with a provided allen wrench and done.  The bike is made of solid metal (steel maybe?), is very sturdy but not too heavy for even my toddler.  He is able to pick it up and maneuver it himself.  We have left the bike outside accidentally and the paint and bike is still like new.  A very sturdy bike, a great design and the concept of a balance bike was perfect for my son.  Once he warmed up to the idea of being on the bike, he walked while standing for the first month or so, has since learned to sit and walk and now if quickly catching onto the idea that he can control how fast he goes!!  Last month I raised the seat for the first time and he still has plenty of room to grow with this bike.  We will use this bike until he is ready to transition into a bike with pedals and no training wheels.  He'll be ready thanks to Strider!"|Usability

(See local growler fill rules/state laws)<br />NO COMPLAINTS ABOUT THIS GROWLER!!!<br /><br />Quick test Note: May not be 100% accurate but just to give anyone reading an idea.<br />I poured (5) 12oz beers and left growler out for a few hours at room temp not exposed to direct sunlight while I drank from it. Drink stayed as cold as when I first poured. I did leave some of the left over beer overnight to see how it held up in the growler and the only downside was that next morning I noticed the beer did start to go flat. I understand this would happen and I just wanted to see how it would hold up. Noting surprising but I personally would recommend no longer then 24 hours in a pinch but most probably drink five beers in that time anyways. After that beer starts to go flat. Recommended average time for a growler is max 36 hours.<br />This growler is highly recommend as it is easy to hold when filled, easy to pour, not designed to drink directly from the spout but you can."|Product Quality

The first time I ran it without the water turned on (my fault, but it can detect that there's no water nd it keeps running anyway -- what the hell!) and it developed a leak.  I'd had it about 30 days and the company exchanged it for me.  The 2nd time I have been using it correctly with great results for about 1 year.  Then yesterday it started making a different noise than it usually makes -- it sounded like a pump was frozen up - and there was a burning smell.  And it again developed a leak in the bottom.  Disappointed.  It's probably past the warrantee now so I'll likely just have to junk it.  Not sure if I will get another one or not as they all seem to be the same brand available on Amazon so they may all have the same quality issues."|Usability

"67|[[VIDEOID:3bdd17778455ef097fcffb1d018022b6]] There is a good variance in Bluetooth speakers, from physical design, extras in the box and sound quality. Not all speakers are worth your time and money. This little Cube speaker by iGadgitz is a very interesting speaker; it may be little but it has big sound and it works very well. I did find one potential issue when it comes to the range of operation that I will describe below.<br /><br />This is one of the smallest speakers I have seen and used. In spite of its size, it is a solid and hefty little speaker, weighing more than you'd expect. In my mind this is a good sign: it means that there is more to this little speaker than a cheap little speaker and a sub-par receiver. To be honest I was a little skeptical that it would put out good sound when I first saw this speaker. It has pleasantly surprised me (more on that shortly).<br /><br />This speaker pairs and connects very easily. When it is in discoverable mode it identifies itself as \\""Xquare 2\\"". I had no issue with it pairing to my phone and once connected it remained connected without issue.<br /><br />The range on this speaker is good and I have been able to carry it from the source to a distance between 20' - 30' before it began to stutter or cut out. I have seen speakers that have more range but the majority of them fall into this threshold. Now, that said I need to mention an issue that came up in testing that should be kept in mind. If the speaker is sitting such that the switch and controls are facing down (that is, the control side is on the flat surface where it is sitting) the range is cut very dramatically. With the speaker sitting that way the range dropped to about 6' before it started cutting out. It did not seem to matter if it was the speaker that was moving away from the source or the other way around.<br /><br />I loaded up some music and played it through this speaker and was pleased with the outcome. The speaker has no problem with playing at higher volume, without distortion or \\""washing out\\"". The profile is very good too - the bass is strong and slightly elevated but not overkill, the midrange is very good and the music has depth as a result, and the highs are bright and crisp. For such a small speaker, this one produces better-than-expected sound.<br /><br />This is one of my favorite Bluetooth speakers. It is very small but it has excellent sound and is made very well. The size makes it placeable in areas where other speakers are too bulky to fit. This speaker proves that smaller speakers can have great sound and it's worth its asking price.<br /><br />Disclaimer: I was provided a sample of this product in exchange for a fair, honest and thorough review. Even though I received this product at no cost I have rated and reviewed this product without bias, based solely on my experience with it.er volume, without distortion or \\""washing out\\"".

"364|I use this to diffuse essential oil to help with my allergies at night. It looks nice sitting on my bedside table. It does seem a little inconsistent with how long it lasts, which might just have to do with the humidity in my room. Sometimes I can get more than two nights out of a single filling. Other times it's just one night. But it's always been at least one night.<br /><br />I'm sure it varies depending on the quality of oils you use, so I don't want to knock this product since I'm not certain if it's the reason, but I did notice that the scent of the oil is only noticeable for the first few hours. The steam does last all night though so that's good! It's not much steam though, so if you're hoping to use this also as a humidifier I don't think it would work very well.<br /><br />I have two main complaints with this. The first is removing the lid to refill it. I have pretty severe repetitive motion injuries and some nights after a hard day at work I can't quite grip it well enough to open it. It's a pretty wide smooth surface you have to grip to twist it open. And it's not the easiest to put back on either. So if anyone has an injury or illness that makes it difficult to open jars or anything then this will probably give you some issues as well. The second issue I have is the lights under the buttons are crazy bright! I like sleeping in dark, as dark as possible. I put electrical tape over the buttons which helped. But the light still reflects a little bit up through the white top. It's not unbearable, but I'd prefer if there was some way to keep it from lighting up at all. Take note, I'm not talking about the light feature because that can be turned off. I'm talking about the light built into the buttons to signal different things (like whether it's on or not) that can't be turned off."|Usability

"455|I bought this to repair our KitchenAid blender, model KSB5WH4. I could have purchased the part from several suppliers ranging in price from $4.86 to $9 and most charged a little more for shipping. This part from Amazon does seem to be the same factory certified part as described and the package says &#34;made in US&#34; which is nice. Very easy replacement.<br /><br />The coupler on our blender broke apart, that is, the hard, black rubber part broke apart and so only the metal core/insert remained on the blender. I read a few online instructions on replacement and then watched a few youtube videos showing the replacement. Instructions are included with this part and includes a few photos. removal of the old coupler is even easier than the youtube videos show.<br /><br />The coupler core appears to be made of aluminum and is screwed onto a hardened steel shaft. The instructions require you to insert a flat screw driver under the old coupler and just pry it up a few times, rotating your position until it comes off. Because the coupler core is aluminum, it's really just prying the threads up which give way to the harder steel. Once off, you remove any bits of aluminum threads that came off. Then simply screw the new coupler onto the threaded shaft. You can and just need to hand tighten it, counter clockwise. The normal blending motion/direction tightens the coupler further. It literally took me all of 90 seconds to complete the whole replacement."|Usability

You will find yourself pushing trash down by hand to fit additional trash into the bin.  Yuck!  To add insult to injury, the bin does not use a standard size bag.  You have to purchase expensive ones from Viking.  Viking is clearly not the quality brand name it use to be.

"332|Great carrier oil. I use it alone to massage my scalp and my boyfriend scalp. I use it on days where my scalp feels too dry/stripped. My boyfriend had horrendous dry scalp (snowflakes all over his shirt and in his hair :/). I massaged this and occasionally tea tree oil in his hair every night for a few days, and it really cleared his flakes up! The tea tree oil helped, but this alone would be fine. I read it jojoba oil/wax is one of the closest substrates to human sebum (which our skin and scalp produce that make it oily). Seems to work that way. His scalp is realllllly dry and his hair is so thick it just kinda lays there (he can go like...5 days without washing his hair). So I apply very liberally throughout his whole scalp. Seems to do the trick! He loves how it makes his hair more manageable and actually &#34;do something&#34; (his words).<br /><br />Really great moisturizer too. I think it'll come in handy in the cold, windy winters here where it is hard to retain moisture. I think it would feel wonderful warmed up and massaged into the scalp or body :)."|Usability

Systainer handle was detached, T Lock detached,  systainer lay out picture shredded, internal  moulded foam padding broken. (This may sound picky, but working systainer boxes make organizing and transporting tools much easier.)  The router however is top notch.  Dust collection is superior to all other routers I have (and I have many).  Handling is also excellent,  this machine is heavy but its weight seems to improve control.  Very powerful, just as a test I installed a 3.25&#34; raised panel profile bit, no problem with control and produced an smooth edge.  Also the plunge lock feature allows for fast precision adjustments to depth.  If you use a router often and can handle the cost, this one's a good choice.  The accessory kit is also costly but almost a necessity."|Shipping

This was the first material issue I have had with them.<br /><br />The bases themselves are rigid and easily adjustable. However you do have to really think about how to affix your tool to the base.  Figuring out how to attach the tool to a 3/4 inch plywood sheet is easy but then attaching the sheet tightly to the base takes some thought.  Each tool required a different configuration because no two had the same bolt down arrangement. The provided hole in the corners does not lend itself well to many of my tools, but oversizing the base addressed the issue."|Customer Service

"473|I love this machine! and the matching dryer too!<br /><br />Ok to set the record straight. About 4 years ago I fell for the &#34;all about being green front loader&#34;.  I bought an LG Front loader...It has been one of the most miserable 4 years of doing laundry imaginable. I would have never expected such an absolute nightmare. My laundry room has been stacked sky high with clothes that stink so bad that I would have to re-wash them four or five times until they were even wearable. I tried everything, I called the manufacture and begged for guidance! After multiple washings, I would resort to filling the bathtub and soaking all of the dark clothes. I even turned to using bleach - which I haven't used in decades. I couldn't take it anymore. I bought the Speed Queen AYN412 and the matching Dryer. I couldn't be happier with my new SPEED QUEEN I LOVE IT!. I would highly recommend this product.<br /><br />I received my new Speed Queen Washer and Dryer four days ago. It is fantastic! Yes... It looks and acts old-school. (It is true that my neighbor did kind of snicker when she saw it and even more when I told her how happy I was about my new Washer and Dryer) But I love this washer and dryer set. The clothes come out clean smelling and the towels are so fluffy! They look and feel like they have been actually washed. I know right? Imagine that! The clothes come out of the dryer warm and mostly wrinkle free. I can put in as many clothes in this machine as my old LG Front loader with no problem.  I have washed 16 loads of wash in 4 days. I have washed everything from white towels to washable delicate silk and even pantyhose.... Every load - Perfect every time! AND you might want to sit down for this... It takes 50 minutes to wash AND dry a load of laundry. Yep this working mom is very happy about that.  GOODBYE crappy - beat the heck out of the my clothes LG Front loader... Goodbye Forever - we are never never ever getting back together..... P.S. ... As far as the water savings... are you kidding? one load being washed five times only to be sent to a full bathtub doesn't look like any kind of savings to me.vings... are you kidding? one load being washed five times only to be sent to a full bathtub doesn't look like any kind of savings to me."|Usability

"73|So, I wouldn't have purchased this if it were not for my wife, who is infinitely frustrated with my audio setup.<br /><br />I needed something that would sit next to our TV, and be simple to use.  The fact that this has a remote is a nice bonus.  The fact that this can grab my local radio stations is a HUGE bonus - one which I didn't know it could do (does it via streaming).<br /><br />My problem is that I have this setup:<br /><br />Computer requests audio to be played from a Linux computer which uses a M2Tech Hiface to stream digital to my DAC (streamed lossless FLAC).  This then feeds into my preamp, and then amp and speakers.  To access the linux computer that runs the whole show, I have to have her use shell login to my linux host (not easy for most people, and if something goes wrong, she can't fix it).  You can then  from command line play pandora or music.<br /><br />So, those issues being stated, after plenty of research, I chose this.  I can connect this up right into my preamp, and she can use it pretty easily.  The setup was a snap, follow a few instructions, and I'm now linked up with my pandora account (I've got probably 40 stations I've been grooming for years).  Great.<br /><br />I had mistook the &#34;antenna&#34; in the product pictures for a coax hookup for an AM/FM antenna.  In fact this hookup is for the antenna to your wireless router.  Very fortunately, this nice box has the great feature of being able to pickup any radio station that streams their broadcasts (which as it turns out, is almost all of the local stations).  Not only that, but I can get stations that I would otherwise not be able to get at all (since I don't rely on an antenna, just whatever I choose to stream).  how do I get my local stations?  Simple !  you just set your location (enter your city I believe).  And it'll select the right stations for where you are.  It will also allow you to then progress outwards and grab more stations that you wouldn't otherwise be able to get with an antenna of probably any size.  I live in Baltimore, and it allows me to get stations hundreds of miles away!  Very slick!!<br /><br />The one downside to this product is that the built-in amplifier is really pretty poor quality.  However, I didn't buy this for that functionality anyway.  I only ended up using it, as my preamp crapped out, and I'm stuck using the built in amp for the time being.  It's nice that it's available, but don't think that if you have decent speakers, that you'll get very good sound quality.  You're much better off using the 'line out' and putting this into your favorite receiver or preamp, as the built in one just isn't so great, but it's functional.ith an antenna of probably any size.

I bought it because of price to try it, and discovered I like a few more pockets for organisation, so this pack doesn't suit me and I will sell it. But make no mistake, this is a top notch pack, despite it's incredible light weight of 175 grams. Eg, the shoulder straps look like cheap mesh plastic at first glance. But pull it. It's tough and doesn't strech, right? Similarly, none of the stitching gives, and the fabric  is , well, tough.<br /><br />If this type of design suits you, then I'd recommend this pack. If it had 1 or 2 more pockets, I'd keep mine."|Aesthetic Appeal

"629|I returned a pair of Roller Derby skates a bought a couple weeks ago and replaced them with these. I reviewed those also.  Save yourself money and hassle and buy these instead.<br /><br />These are amazingly great blades!  I feel like I should have paid more for them since they are so comfortable, smooth on the ground, and they don't have the crappy BOA lacing system that plagues many other K2 skates.  I guess time will tell how long these laces will hold up, but they are great so far.  The laces simply draw tight by pulling them up through the tongue.  They stay tight while skating.<br /><br />I was wanting to get a skate with 90+mm wheels (like my old K2s with the cruddy BOA lacing system) because the terrain I skate on is rocky and sandy.  I was pleasantly surprised and how when these glide over imperfect surfaces and resist rocks and debris.  I think that great shape of the skate and how well they fit your feet deserves the credit for the smooth operation.<br /><br />Ergonomically, these are far superior to the Roller Derby skates I returned and I think they are even better than my last 2 pairs of K2 skates simply because once the laces are tight, they are completely out of the way.  The toe box is well padded and a great shape for my average width feet.  The foot strap is effective and comfortable.  The ankle strap is also effective and comfortable.  When these are on your feet and laced up, you don't feel like you have a clunky contraction on your feet.  These feel like an extension of your foot.  You feel like a superhero with speed skate ability.<br /><br />I probably have 50-60 miles on them.<br /><br />Cheap at twice the price!"|Usability

I hadn't slept but 1 - 2 hours a night at least 5 nights a week and then would sleep heavily  and restlessly for 2 nights.  It sure wore me  down.  When I began using this at only a teaspoon per day in water (it is pleasant) it only  took about a week or so and I have been sleeping ever since - every night.  So very thankful for that neighbor's suggestion.  I am passing on the word to others  who cannot sleep."|Usability

"835|Just be careful when buying them as some vendors advertise box of 12 but only ship one  Ask first before ordering.<br /><br />Remember one thing about less than 180 degree vision: anything you see wearing safety or any other glass's is that anything you see is either a threat or an opportunity  Other products that block side vision are for my world 'dangerous' .<br /><br />180 degree vision is important.  Looking cool is not why I buy them  Any time I am out mowing changing the shape of something these are what I wear to protect my eyes from the bright sun light.<br /><br />Unfortunately I learned too late how important that protection is.<br />Never go outside without them is the new rule.<br />These are so light, you know they are there but hardly feel them<br /><br />These allow almost no unfiltered light  getting to your eyes."|Usability

"602|3rd season using it. I only fill with water and immediately drain and air dry after every hike. I have experienced no altered taste or smells with this simple care. [Use your Nalgene for flavored water and alcohol!]<br />It's best to fill and pack first for ease in an overnight pack, but can still slide in with a full pack. I've had no issues with suction/water flow. Osprey changed the tube size to 1/4&#34;, which is a good thing as it it fits most quick change valves (mine is cut to allow for direct input from my water pump).<br /><br />The knock - the cap. You're going to have issues and it's only a question of when. The twist cap becomes stuck making it so you have to hold the blue plastic clip in order to securely twist the cap into place. I've found using olive oil (any vegetable oil will do)  on a Q-tip to lubricate the cap between the grey and blue part works well. Probably should avoid a synthetic lubricant like WD-40 unless you're feeling adventurous and are okay with your water smelling like your car's last oil change. This is where the old reservoir has it better - the cap on the old one is highly reliable.<br />Overall, it's good and would be 5-star with a better and more reliable cap (I'd prefer not having to take cautious lubricating measures every time I go on overnight trips).<br /><br />As with all resevoirs and water filtration devices, proper care is necessary. Take 3 minutes to pull it out of your pack immediately, drain, insert a paper towel, and then hang to dry. Unless of course you prefer that old musty scent. I do expect better though of Osprey with regard to the cap considering I'm not the only one who has to deal with this issue."|Product Quality
"119|I bought this 10 days ago. It was relatively easy to hook up. The auto-calibration took a few tries to get right, but I was pleased with the outcome. The sound was fantastic and really enhanced the viewing experience of my new Sony 4k 70&#34; television.<br /><br />Today it died. I was watching Band of Brothers, and halfway through episode 3 the sound just died. I did my own troubleshooting (I have an advanced degree in electrical engineering) and then called Sony support. They ran me through a few steps, and then escalated me to another department. After being on hold for 40 minutes, the line kicked off and said that the office I was trying to reach was closed for the day.<br /><br />So I am now 10 days into a three thousand dollar investment with Sony, and I am watching a football game with no sound while I type this.<br /><br />My receiver was a poor product. And the support line was awful.<br /><br />I am not happy."|Customer Service

After trying it out for one day, it was clear the straps are not made for hauling every day items (i.e. a work laptop and plug) as they spread out on the shoulders and make it difficult to walk and carry. After expressing a desire to return the bag, the sellers were not accommodating and really didn't care that it wasn't working for our situation. Bottom line: the design is nice, but beware that once you try it and realize it is not a great bag for you, you are stuck with it."|Aesthetic Appeal

I wanted to be the one young person who didn't have a wearable piece of technology, but when I found a Fitbit Charge HR for half price at an REI Garage Sale I couldn't pass it up.  For someone who is an avid cyclist and exercise junky I have used this little watch more than expected.  It has been such a useful tool for my health and workouts and I cannot seem to live without it now! It tracks my sleep and shows me when I have been awake/restless throughout the night and gives me goals for a good nights sleep. I like that it counts all of my steps during my day, including my rides, which has been super helpful.  The only issues I have found with my Fitbit so far is minor troubles with syncing it to my computer and phone. I just have to reset the Fitbit and it syncs right back into the system! The best part about the reset function is that it only restarts the Fitbit itself and NOT your data! :)"|Aesthetic Appeal

(See local growler fill rules/state laws)<br />NO COMPLAINTS ABOUT THIS GROWLER!!!<br /><br />Quick test Note: May not be 100% accurate but just to give anyone reading an idea.<br />I poured (5) 12oz beers and left growler out for a few hours at room temp not exposed to direct sunlight while I drank from it. Drink stayed as cold as when I first poured. I did leave some of the left over beer overnight to see how it held up in the growler and the only downside was that next morning I noticed the beer did start to go flat. I understand this would happen and I just wanted to see how it would hold up. Noting surprising but I personally would recommend no longer then 24 hours in a pinch but most probably drink five beers in that time anyways. After that beer starts to go flat. Recommended average time for a growler is max 36 hours.<br />This growler is highly recommend as it is easy to hold when filled, easy to pour, not designed to drink directly from the spout but you can."|Product Quality

This is also the brightest light I've ever owned, one of my colleagues now has flashlight envy.  His &#34;S-light&#34; isn't nearly as bright and it's twice the size and price.  Definitely a must have!"|Product Quality

"626|I really like the packaging of these microfiber towels. Each pouch (2) have a drawstring to close it. There's a small cloth for wiping sweat, and a larger towel to do yoga on. The larger mat is non- slip, and when wet it dries very quickly. I like to have wash these abs let them air dry. The pink is really pretty.  The material is kind-of thinner then I thought. But it still gets the job done. Also getting the towels back in the pouch wasnt easy . I had to refold them a few times to get it to fit. But overall I'm happy with this purchase. I received this product at a discounted price in exchange for my honest review."|Product Quality

The second 100 I received were cut incorrectly and I couldn't even get the record inside of them. I sent those back and re-ordered, when the 3rd shipment arrived they fit perfectly but some of them are cut too short and don't even reach the top of the record.<br /><br />This would be a great product if the company had better quality control standards, as is I won't be using these in the future."|Product Quality

"622|This is my second time buying this system from RAD Cycle. It works very well, the price is reasonable, and opens up my garage floor. The only thing to be aware of is that the installation is not very hard, but will most likely require attaching it to a board, before it's attached to the ceiling. There is another option out there that comes with it's own board integrated in, which would make the installation just a little faster."|Usability

"836|It is very difficult to find decent gloves to fit a woman's hand. All women's gloves I have seen are worthy only of potting plants, not real work. I'd been using a very similar looking, small, men's leather gloves from a big-box store, but the fingers would wear out very quickly.  These have been great so far. I love the extra piece of leather on the first two fingers and the thumb, which is where the others always wore out. There is a little extra padding on the palm and knuckles. The padding may make them a little warmer than typical light-duty gloves. The side of the forefinger is reinforced as well. The construction overall is very good.  The small size fits my hands (which are med/large women's size) well, although it is a tad bit bigger than my usual brand. I am very happy so far and will follow up in time when they are used more.  Update: 5 Months later and they are holding up great. I have been doing a lot of shoveling and working with chicken wire, cement blocks and gravel. They have been used in both wet and dry situations."|Product Quality

"920|I really like this tent.  I'm quite happy with it especially for the price.  I set it up once in my yard to learn how to do it before using it at the beach.  It worked great.<br />---Set up is pretty straight forward - simple directions. Picture directions.<br />---I used it at the beach,  it was a VERY windy day.  Well, after I set up the tent and had anchored it with the provided pins I noticed it started to lift a little with a big gust, so then I immediately filled the provided sandbags & they nicely weighted the tent down by hanging from the outer part of the tent.  Also, just for fun the kids buried the 2 bottom horizontal poles under sand & rocks the collected and we through some rocks in the bottom inner pocket of the liner.  We also out the cooler down on the bottom horizontal poles to add more weight.  After that:::zero lift, the tent was secured & worked beautifully all day.  Again, it was a very windy beach day.<br />---This tent is nice & light to carry with the shoulder strap - couple pounds only.<br />---Pretty easy dismantle just undo the corner poles then they nicely buckle down to fold.  The rest of the tent folds up rather nicely.  I got 8t back in the bag easily.<br />---This blocked a lot of sun.  It can be shifted around a bit to face the sun to block more sun. I even hung a blanket in the back for more privacy.  I didn't use sunscreen while sitting under it and got no color-I am a red head and can burn in 20 minutes.  But, I was fine under here!<br />---3 of us fit under it no problem.  We lined our towels in it and sat or laid down just like I would normally do at the beach.  Plenty of head room while sitting, but if you want to bring a chair you'd need a low beach chair not a regular chair height or you'd most likely make contact with the top.  You can't stand under this it's too low, but, who stands at the beach?<br />---I love that this tent is simple and WAY more nonchalant than most beach tents that I've seen.  I don't want a huge structure that's florescent and blocks the beach view off and is the size of a room.  No, I want simple, not too much $ and not too showy - and that what this tent is.<br />---The anchor pins are a little short (4 or 5 inches approx) for use in beach sand because the sand is so smooth that they could come out easily - they just don't go deep enough to reach the hard sand at the beach.  So I'll be buying longer pins, like 10 inch size or a foot."|Price
"101|First off, I bought this product on sale for $25 off of Amazon. What a great deal, this bluetooth speaker is LOUD! It's got fair bass levels for the size and price point. Both front and back of the device emit sound, though front is louder. I think this gives it better quality and more range. I use this out by the pool and plan on using for fishing trips and tailgates. The only reason i did not give it 5 stars, when pressing the volume +/- the music stops for a &#34;boop&#34; noise. Also, when powering on, changing modes, or pairing a device, the speaker plays a womens voice that sounds almost comical. It's a little goofy, but at this price point who cares. This speaker is comparable to high end units of the same size, with just slightly less bass.<br /><br />Thanks Amazon!"|Usability

"445|I rarely do reviews, but wanted to let people know about the deceptive marketing on this dishwasher.  We did a remodel and due to space constraints needed an 18 inch dishwasher.  We replaced a Kenmore dishwasher rated at 50 db.  The Bosch sounds like a freight train in our kitchen compared to the Kenmore.  We couldn't tell the Kenmore was on, but with the Bosch we can't run it when we are home.  It drowns out the TV and forget about getting any sleep when it is running (the bedroom is on one side of the kitchen and the living room on the other).  Whoever rated this at 46 db must be hard of hearing.<br /><br />The plus side is that it has great features and cleans well.  The only other negative is that door doesn't let you prop it open.  I like to open it a couple inches after it is done to let the dishes dry thoroughly.  The Kenmore would stay in any partially open position, but the Bosch is basically full open or closed and there is no way to adjust the tension on the spring to operate the door."|Usability

"482|[[ASIN:B00JCG9H0W Electrolux EI24ID50QS Built-In Dishwasher with IQ Touch Controls, 24-Inch, Stainless Steel]] This has been disappointing, to say the least. We had the dishwasher professionally installed, and ran a test cycle. A little more than half way through the cycle, it beeped and gave an error message. I called customer service number and spent two hours in the circle of hell known as voicemail carousel, cut-off, call back, runaround, &#34;try this number instead,&#34; and so on. Finally got a repairman out, twice now, and it still has not run through a complete cycle without shutting down with an error message. It has now been 3 weeks since we bought it, and nearly 2 weeks since we had it installed, and we still do not have a working dishwasher. Update: After the backordered parts were installed, it immediately sprung another leak before finishing a load of dishes. More parts have been backordered. It has now been 46 days since I ordered this, and it has never run through a cycle. Electrolux has refused to refund, but Amazon is considering making an exception to their 30 day return policy since the backordered parts kept me waiting."|Customer Service
"598|I had read reviews extensively before trying this filter. This filter did not work for me. It filters about half a glass of water in 10 minutes or so. Have tried to shake it and reinstall. Thought that an initial clog may eventually get cleared but 30 days down the line it's still just a trickle of water every 15 minutes.<br /><br />This might just be a defective peice but in the last 12 years I have never had such an experience with the original filtrrs.

It's a dogbone shape and I would prefer  the opposite with more support in the center of the back and a little less width. I have bought three of these in the past year because I like them so much. Also, the McKenzie back support (also very good) has similar limitations in color choice and shape. IF I could give this 4.5 stars I would but just holding back a little for color and shape."|Product Quality

The bottle itself is very well made, seems sturdy and it arrived well packaged, with no funky smells (a great plus!). I fill the infusing container in the morning and refill it with water multiple times during the day. I usually use cucumbers plus some fragrant like fresh mint leaves, basil or slices of ginger.

"356|I have pretty severe Sjogren's Syndrome (dry eyes, nose, and mouth), and I have tried EVERYTHING.... It also doesn't help that I live in MI where the winter climates are cold & extremely dry. Every other product I have so far tried, either doesn't work at all or if it works, it only helps for about 5-10 minutes and then I have to re-apply. This product isn't a miracle, but out of everything I've tried, it seems to work the best. I especially have trouble wearing my contacts because my eyes are so dry, and this helps prolong my wear time (not by much, but I can at least sit through a movie now). Although a strange feeling that goes against every natural human reaction, I spray this onto open eyes. The directions say that it isn't necessary and that the product will still work if you close your eyes, but it lasts longer for me if I spray onto open eyes. I will definitely re-purchase this. And while this can easily fit in your purse, I do wish they'd make an even smaller one (like pocket size)."|Usability

"473|I love this machine! and the matching dryer too!<br /><br />Ok to set the record straight. About 4 years ago I fell for the &#34;all about being green front loader&#34;.  I bought an LG Front loader...It has been one of the most miserable 4 years of doing laundry imaginable. I would have never expected such an absolute nightmare. My laundry room has been stacked sky high with clothes that stink so bad that I would have to re-wash them four or five times until they were even wearable. I tried everything, I called the manufacture and begged for guidance! After multiple washings, I would resort to filling the bathtub and soaking all of the dark clothes. I even turned to using bleach - which I haven't used in decades. I couldn't take it anymore. I bought the Speed Queen AYN412 and the matching Dryer. I couldn't be happier with my new SPEED QUEEN I LOVE IT!. I would highly recommend this product.<br /><br />I received my new Speed Queen Washer and Dryer four days ago. It is fantastic! Yes... It looks and acts old-school. (It is true that my neighbor did kind of snicker when she saw it and even more when I told her how happy I was about my new Washer and Dryer) But I love this washer and dryer set. The clothes come out clean smelling and the towels are so fluffy! They look and feel like they have been actually washed. I know right? Imagine that! The clothes come out of the dryer warm and mostly wrinkle free. I can put in as many clothes in this machine as my old LG Front loader with no problem.  I have washed 16 loads of wash in 4 days. I have washed everything from white towels to washable delicate silk and even pantyhose.... Every load - Perfect every time! AND you might want to sit down for this... It takes 50 minutes to wash AND dry a load of laundry. Yep this working mom is very happy about that.  GOODBYE crappy - beat the heck out of the my clothes LG Front loader... Goodbye Forever - we are never never ever getting back together..... P.S. ... As far as the water savings... are you kidding? one load being washed five times only to be sent to a full bathtub doesn't look like any kind of savings to me.vings... are you kidding? one load being washed five times only to be sent to a full bathtub doesn't look like any kind of savings to me."|Product Quality

"649|I purchased this bag partly based on other reviews, and I must say I am SOOOOO happy that I did!  This bag is fabulous.  I was looking for something that was not the standard, boring black messenger bag, and this is it!  My laptop fits perfectly - it's a Dell 14&#34;.  I was a bit concerned that one reviewer said that he/she had to slice open the laptop sleeve to get the laptop to fit, but my 14&#34; (with extended battery) fits just fine.  This bag is - in the Goldilocks sense - not too big, not too small, but just right.  It is well-designed, with lots of pockets.  It has a strap across the back that I ended up removing because I don't need it (if you ride a bike with the bag, I guess it would be helpful).  The bag is not black, but more like a charcoal color, if that makes a difference.  It can fit a water bottle, but that takes up some of the internal space because of the way the pocket is designed.  This is not a flaw, but something to note if you carry a water bottle and also want to pack more than a laptop and a few folders or a binder.  If you need to carry more than a laptop and maybe one binder or textbook, you will need a bigger bag, but if you're looking for a stylish way to transport your laptop plus a binder or book, this bag is AWESOME.  Super sturdy, well designed, cool pattern, good padding on the laptop sleeve, and some reflective trim for safety, without looking too &#34;sporty&#34;."|Aesthetic Appeal

"354|These bands have done wonders for the pain in my husbands knees! The very first time he used them he walked all day without pain- in fact he forgot they were even on!

He wears, as you can see in the pictures, them below his knees but since they are so adjustable I'm sure they'd work in the area of choice. Perfect size and thickness. Not hot or sweaty. No bulk under his clothing either. Great great product!  Neoprene material- quality construction. Received in exchange for my honest review   Ok so my husband has been wearing these every day and he reported that they WORK!! So much less pain- don't not know why or how but the do.

"694|This headlamp certainly does what I need it to.  I work on wind turbines for a living, and the low setting is great for most times when I need light in a dark area/cabinet/junction box, etc. The dial is much easier and faster to operate than a push button, especially when wearing gloves.  It also comes with a clip that's compatible with Petzl hard hats (which we use), so there's no need to buy an extra headband (or headlamp for that matter).  I can slide this one off my hard hat and onto the soft headband that came with it and get right to work. After pivoting, the light stays secure in that position, and it's ruggedly built. If you use it frequently, it does have a tendency to eat batteries - energizer ultimate lithiums lasted about 2.5 - 3 days of almost continual use.  Other than that, I'm loving this headlamp."|Usability
"180|Fairly sturdy, all metal construction, it did come with wall anchors, screws & straps to secure it upright if you need to do so. No missing parts, and the fit & finish are very good. Instructions are very basic, but it's easy tool free assembly means a 1 sheet instruction page is fine.<br /><br />As the shelves are adjustable to wherever you want them to go, you may have extra shelves leftover depending on how and where you place them on the poles.  As I migrate my DVD collection to Blu-Ray, I'll shrink the space between shelves and add the extras later.<br /><br />Overall, very pleased with this product at this price point."|Product Quality

"447|Nice unit, however, only works with what I would say is standard slim wine bottles. Any bottle that is odd size will not fit on the racks.  So, to use the fridge for varying size wine bottles you would have to remove some shelves to allow them to fit which reduces the capacity.  I'm sending mine back, which has not been a problem so far working with Amazon."|Customer Service
"73|So, I wouldn't have purchased this if it were not for my wife, who is infinitely frustrated with my audio setup.<br /><br />I needed something that would sit next to our TV, and be simple to use.  The fact that this has a remote is a nice bonus.  The fact that this can grab my local radio stations is a HUGE bonus - one which I didn't know it could do (does it via streaming).<br /><br />My problem is that I have this setup:<br /><br />Computer requests audio to be played from a Linux computer which uses a M2Tech Hiface to stream digital to my DAC (streamed lossless FLAC).  This then feeds into my preamp, and then amp and speakers.  To access the linux computer that runs the whole show, I have to have her use shell login to my linux host (not easy for most people, and if something goes wrong, she can't fix it).  You can then  from command line play pandora or music.<br /><br />So, those issues being stated, after plenty of research, I chose this.  I can connect this up right into my preamp, and she can use it pretty easily.  The setup was a snap, follow a few instructions, and I'm now linked up with my pandora account (I've got probably 40 stations I've been grooming for years).  Great.<br /><br />I had mistook the &#34;antenna&#34; in the product pictures for a coax hookup for an AM/FM antenna.  In fact this hookup is for the antenna to your wireless router.  Very fortunately, this nice box has the great feature of being able to pickup any radio station that streams their broadcasts (which as it turns out, is almost all of the local stations).  Not only that, but I can get stations that I would otherwise not be able to get at all (since I don't rely on an antenna, just whatever I choose to stream).  how do I get my local stations?  Simple !  you just set your location (enter your city I believe).  And it'll select the right stations for where you are.  It will also allow you to then progress outwards and grab more stations that you wouldn't otherwise be able to get with an antenna of probably any size.  I live in Baltimore, and it allows me to get stations hundreds of miles away!  Very slick!!<br /><br />The one downside to this product is that the built-in amplifier is really pretty poor quality.  However, I didn't buy this for that functionality anyway.  I only ended up using it, as my preamp crapped out, and I'm stuck using the built in amp for the time being.  It's nice that it's available, but don't think that if you have decent speakers, that you'll get very good sound quality.  You're much better off using the 'line out' and putting this into your favorite receiver or preamp, as the built in one just isn't so great, but it's functional.ith an antenna of probably any size.

"954|The real deal DeWalt batteries! If you need these, you may want to get them soon. Being NiCad batteries, you don't want them to go dead before recharging--and mine only had a small charge left in them, when they arrived. Probably remaining old stock (everything is going Li-Ion nowadays,) so it'll soon get to the point that any original DeWalt batteries you get, of this type, may have discharged completely in storage. Then the only fresh battery packs available will be the aftermarket manufacturer's."|Product Quality
"653|These little flashlights are great.  I actually have three of them: one for my keychain, one in my toolbox, and one I carry on my very-early-morning constitutional (my little finger fits perfectly into its ring).  I also gave one to each of my 12 grandchildren (ages 5 to  22)  for Xmas last year, though one was immediately stolen by his father.  The CR2016 batteries last a long time (if your remember to turn the light off when you're not using it, which some of my grandchildren don't) but they are a bit of a bother to replace, and they are hard to find in retail stores.  You might  want to buy the  pack of spares along with your light."|Usability

I hadn't slept but 1 - 2 hours a night at least 5 nights a week and then would sleep heavily  and restlessly for 2 nights.  It sure wore me  down.  When I began using this at only a teaspoon per day in water (it is pleasant) it only  took about a week or so and I have been sleeping ever since - every night.  So very thankful for that neighbor's suggestion.  I am passing on the word to others  who cannot sleep."|Usability

"626|I really like the packaging of these microfiber towels. Each pouch (2) have a drawstring to close it. There's a small cloth for wiping sweat, and a larger towel to do yoga on. The larger mat is non- slip, and when wet it dries very quickly. I like to have wash these abs let them air dry. The pink is really pretty.  The material is kind-of thinner then I thought. But it still gets the job done. Also getting the towels back in the pouch wasnt easy . I had to refold them a few times to get it to fit. But overall I'm happy with this purchase.

"378|I'm not one to believe hype but I thought I'd give this product a try in preparation for the birth of my first child.<br /><br />Now I am currently 19 days postpartum, I delivered a 8lb baby boy via the help of a forcep delivery. I had several tears that were 2nd degree tears including a brutal episiotomy and severe hemorrhoids. My body was battered and bruised after 36hrs in labor and 4 hrs of pushing. I remember two days after coming home from the hospital and just crying in the shower because I had severe PTSD from L&D and also I was so wrecked in my most sensitive area that I was in constant pain.<br /><br />My care routine consisted of witch hazel diluted with water in my peribottle that I stole from the hospital (it really was my best friend after I would use the bathroom) but right next up the peribottle was this new mama bottom spray. After I would clean up with the peribottle I would spray this on and although I was so numb and swollen down there that I couldn't feel much of a cooling sensation. I loved the smell and the idea that it was helping me heal.<br /><br />More than two weeks postpartum I'm back in my feet and still using this spray which is in fact very cooling and very refreshing. I still have a long way to go in recovering down there, but this product has helped so far :)  I would gladly recommend it to any new moms out there recovering from child birth."|Product Quality

"368|I previously gave this a mediocre review, because it seemed to give me a stomach ache when I made a carrot cake with it. I continued to use it though in smaller amounts. I haven't had the problem since, and it may just be that I at way too much all at once (frosting, etc.), or else it was the combined ingredients of the cake I ate. I love this stuff. It's so much like sugar and even has the mouth-feel of sugar. I always feel like I'm cheating when I eat it, but I don't get any weight gain or blood sugar surges. I love stevia too, but it's only good in certain things. Swerve is great in everything. I've served it to people without telling them it wasn't sugar, and no one knew the difference. About to order more now. Yum! :P<br /><br />PREVIOUS REVIEW:<br />Love the taste of this stuff, and it would probably be ok in small amounts, but after making a frosted carrot cake using Swerve, I found then it caused quite a bit of nausea. The feeling is similar to what it feels like when you eat way too much sugar. Yet when I tested my blood sugar, it hadn't gone up. Both my boyfriend and I experienced this on both occasions after eating a piece of cake made with this sweetener. The cake taste great, but I won't be buying this again."|Product Quality
