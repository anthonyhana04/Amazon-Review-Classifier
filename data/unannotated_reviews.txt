"615|This is a fine mount, but the garmin mount doesn't fit any Garmin I have even with the available adapters. The straw sticks up in the air, costing some aero energy, but you can stick some Velcro on the frame and around the straw and push it down. There's probably a less expensive solution to a BTA hydration system, but this is easy to install and convenient and lightweight."
"952|If you use this product on something that has lead paint on it, you will quickly see the swabbed area turn pink or red. You need to be able to test down through all layers of paint, so cutting some away with a knife to get to lower levels is helpful. If there is no lead, you will still see an orange color because the liquid in the product is orange.  Having the test sheet to see the expected color change for a positive result was helpful. There are directions for using the product on a red surface.<br /><br />I tried removing some lead paint with a liquid paint stripper. Retested the bare wood, and it still tested positive. Better to cover it up and seal it in."

"324|Good price :)"
"482|[[ASIN:B00JCG9H0W Electrolux EI24ID50QS Built-In Dishwasher with IQ Touch Controls, 24-Inch, Stainless Steel]] This has been disappointing, to say the least. We had the dishwasher professionally installed, and ran a test cycle. A little more than half way through the cycle, it beeped and gave an error message. I called customer service number and spent two hours in the circle of hell known as voicemail carousel, cut-off, call back, runaround, &#34;try this number instead,&#34; and so on. Finally got a repairman out, twice now, and it still has not run through a complete cycle without shutting down with an error message. It has now been 3 weeks since we bought it, and nearly 2 weeks since we had it installed, and we still do not have a working dishwasher. Update: After the backordered parts were installed, it immediately sprung another leak before finishing a load of dishes. More parts have been backordered. It has now been 46 days since I ordered this, and it has never run through a cycle. Electrolux has refused to refund, but Amazon is considering making an exception to their 30 day return policy since the backordered parts kept me waiting."
"165|When I bought this speaker, I had one request.... I want to be able to wake up to the music of the Harry Potter Intro in mp3 with a soft wake up (volume gradually going up (which I emulated in audacity)).... Which I recommend to anyone with a relative light sleep, it really is magical.<br /><br />Anyway...the mp3 alarm is not reliable... worked fine for 3 days then doesn't start<br />I don't know if it's related to the way you previously stopped the music....unclear....<br />The screen is also way too bright (and quite small) to be used as a clock in a dark room (I put papers on top to soften it a little bit)<br /><br />I tried all buttons and buttons combinations to fix my alarm problem and nothing worked....<br />only unplug, turning off, turning back on fixed it....for one day...."
"133|You won't be disappointed. The only draw back is that you can't change out batteries"
"733|this nose plug does its job as i expected.  while swimming, i can breathe out, but not breathe in (water could not get into my nose, but i could blow air out of my nose, if i chose to).  i have two of these nose plugs, one for each of my two goggles, and have used these nose plugs ever since i bought them for daily swimming.  i rate this product five stars."
"732|this product is good but there are wheels for a lot less that are faster and last longer"
"495|Same as everyone else, NEVER buy Samsung major kitchen appliances. I spent over $5K a little over 5 yrs ago. Dishwasher died in 18m and had to be fully replaced, Bosch working great since the. Refrigerator ice maker died at 2yrs, replaced and 2nd one just died at 3yrs old last month. Now SMH9187 microwave, that worked okay at least for 5 yrs in very light use, just died with broken door latch (like dozens of others hit). Fixed it per YouTube video by drilling new hole in plastic door latch and moving spring. That worked fine but in middle of night 2 days before that, microwave beeped in middle of the night on its own, then had E-13 on the display.   Reset it and now getting either the dreaded SE error or worse, it literally in under 5 minutes suddenly turns on by ITSELF showing something about cooking a potato! Now after seeing hundreds of similar complaints including that microwave caused at least a couple fires I'm now scared to leave it plugged in when not home, especially since I have 3 pets. Going to replace with nice GE new one. Last GE microwave lasted over 12yrs!  Also had 2 Samsung LCD TV's, 1 BluRay and 1 DVD player all die in under 2yrs too.  NEVER, EVER GOING TO BUY ANYTHING FROM SAMSUNG AGAIN!!!  Shame on them for fooling me more than once but beyond shame on them for their utter lack of safety and concern for their customers!"
"282|Very good product , I can fell big deferent in training after 1 week of using it , the only problem with this product is that it too sweet."
"315|OMG! The best lube out on the market! I bought this after reading reviews on other sites. I thought what the heck, if so many people are raving, we should give it a try. My man was a bit reluctant because ALL of the other flavored lube in our drawer tasted like metal and leave a funky after taste and feel sticky (total turn-off OUCH). After trying the Wicked brand - WE'RE SOLD! Not only is it tasty and non sticky, it wipes off easily, no artificial ingredients, and it lasts a long time. The bottle is sleek and discreet, and completely changed our view on flavored lube. It's so good that he threw our other lubes away. Do yourself a flavor (hee hee) and try the pom favor. It's so good I'm tempted to try it over ice cream!"
"965|nothing to really say about this tool it does the job"
"280|Good product. We have noticed a significant difference in the motion of knees and ankles. Motion is a whole lot better and pain significantly less since I purchased this product over a month ago. Just ordered 2nd time a couple of weeks ago."
"245|I cannot believe that after trying for over one whole year to get rid of a wart on my hand, Bazuka Extra Strength did it in one week, I am just flabbergasted! This wart was so persistent and with only 3 treatments (1 every other day for a week) it's gone completely!  I would definitely recommend this product to anyone who wants to clear up warts and/or verrucas quickly!"
"570|FIRE HAZARD - AVOID!!!!!<br />The knobs created two fires in our house already, in the two months we have used the stove.<br />Anyone walking by can accidentally brush against the knob with barely any pressure and accidentally turn on the stove.<br />Once a shoebox sitting on the stove caught on fire, the second time it was a wooden cutting board.<br />This stove should be recalled.  When I complained to our local Samsung appliance technician, he told me that Samsung has had 100's or 1,000's of complaints about this, but that Samsung is actually waiting for people to die before they care to do anything about this.<br />When I called Samsung's corporate &#34;Executive Relations&#34; office I spent over half an hour on hold, then an hour with a true idiot who provided zero assistance.  Their customer service is useless.<br />I WILL NEVER BUY ANOTHER SAMSUNG PRODUCT AGAIN."
"128|Use this everyday at work..  Great noise cancellation.  Wonderful product."
"682|It's thin and lightweight, but too expensive for me. Also, the material is TOO THIN in my opinion. The silk is so smooth though."
"777|Our summer camp in the Catskills was made brighter by Sun King. Thanks."
"668|Awesome helmet for my son.  He says it's the most 'comfortable' helmet he's ever tried.  Has a front visor, looks cool, can take a good beating and fits a little kid with a larger than average head."
"328|This is helpful for those hard to reach spots under a cast.  The spray itself is nice and cool, but the powder smell can be quite strong.  The straw that comes with it is excellent in itself... It's skinny and flexible, and I often use it alone to scratch under the cast.  I assumed that the straw is attached to the nozzle when I bought this, but it is not.  You have to hold the straw to the spray nozzle each time, which is difficult, and you will most likely need help with that part."
"56|Bought these headphones a week ago and I love them. These are the most comfortable headphones I've ever owned. Feels so comfortable even listening for many hours. I own a pair of Audio Technica M50x and these for me are much better. They are much more open and a pleasure to listen to any music. I listen to music mostly on my iPad and have a subscription to Tidal premium musi service right now. The clarity of the music is amazing. These headphones also are a great bargain at $108.99 on Amazon. I'm very happy with my purchase."
"82|They work"
"66|Has great features like iPod dock and USB port, but the sound is so unclear.<br />I am very disappointed"
"9|It works well~~~"
"415|Looking forward to using this product."
"182|I appreciate my speaker, it's loud and clear"
"532|works great, and it's super quiet."
"786|For the price, its amazing.  So fun we bought 2.  One for hte 6 yr old and for the 4 yr old."
"856|Good tool and seems good quality"
"752|Great back pack but zipper ripped out...my boy is tough on things!"
"386|Good Stuff! I did a trial run with this vitapak and then other supplements (that were a bit cheaper in cost). After trials I could tell the difference b/t Raw Re-Loaded and other supplements (i.e. Animal Paks). I got back on Re-Loaded about three months ago and I don't plan on stopping. I'm stronger and bigger! I can tell the positive difference without a shadow of a doubt."
"95|I purchased the OUS00-0563 Super Thin Indoor HDTV and took it to Barbados where after installing it(simply tape to concrete block wall) I was pleasantly surprised by the difference in reception of the TV. I highly recommend this product."
"630|Works well"
"565|Great wall oven, it works as it should and meets all of my standards."
"230|Pretty good!"
"132|For a speaker its size the sound and volume are great. I would recommend this little speaker"
"332|Great carrier oil. I use it alone to massage my scalp and my boyfriend scalp. I use it on days where my scalp feels too dry/stripped. My boyfriend had horrendous dry scalp (snowflakes all over his shirt and in his hair :/). I massaged this and occasionally tea tree oil in his hair every night for a few days, and it really cleared his flakes up! The tea tree oil helped, but this alone would be fine. I read it jojoba oil/wax is one of the closest substrates to human sebum (which our skin and scalp produce that make it oily). Seems to work that way. His scalp is realllllly dry and his hair is so thick it just kinda lays there (he can go like...5 days without washing his hair). So I apply very liberally throughout his whole scalp. Seems to do the trick! He loves how it makes his hair more manageable and actually &#34;do something&#34; (his words).<br /><br />Really great moisturizer too. I think it'll come in handy in the cold, windy winters here where it is hard to retain moisture. I think it would feel wonderful warmed up and massaged into the scalp or body :)."
"582|Awesome product can't wait till my new kitchen is all done ."
"177|Product was defective but the customer service was fantastic.."
"609|I am so glad I bought this lifter over the other. The red grip on the top and handle are great. This holds the lid very sturdy when lifting. Seems to be a very solid construction."
"352|I bought it for myself because I could no longer find good products locally and was happy to see that Amazon carried some. Now several other family members have tried it and like it very much"
"295|Haven't had a chance to use this Grabber very much; but so far, it has lived up to it's reputation.<br />My previous grabber (of 20+ years) did not rotate so I'm looking forward to using this new option.<br />I like the fact that it firmly grabs small items from tall areas."
"416|cheap knock-off. dont waste your time"
"758|Complete made in china crap!  The first pole seam ripped out before I even got the 2nd of 3 poles in.  And the &#34;tarp&#34;, if you can call it that, is about as durable as a disposable rain poncho. Worst &#34;quality&#34; ever!  Even if you could get it together it would rip in the sun after less than a weeks use I am sure...... And the material is made of something that leaves little sharp things in your hands like fiberglass when you fold it back up.  Oh and the zipper on the bag ripped out when I tried to stuff it back in for the return.<br /><br />The only thing I liked was that Amazon is giving me a complete refund with free return shipping :)"
"915|Work great, great price"
"558|Filter works just great with my fridge. Thanks for the prompt delivery too!!!😀"
"374|I have read a Lot of negative on this product..I too was skeptical as my knees are bone on bone and will need to be replaced after the 4 surgeries i have had in the past....It took about a week,and I honestly walk every day rain or shine as I have to walk the dog,and one night I got up to go to bathroom and i was surprised my knees didnt hurt like normal...I am amazed,I have ordered my second bottle and will continue to exercise and take advantage of this new freedom from the constant pain..It Is Not a cure all..But,after all these years and shots in my knees..This has truly been a gift to me"
"666|Leaks like a sieve at the mouthpiece. I held out for this one over some cheap numbers they were selling at the local big box hardware store, thinking this one was the real deal. Didn't quite pan out...and who's gonna mail a jug back?"
"695|my grandson loves this scooter,the best birthday ever!"
"45|I LOVE THESE HEADPHONES! I am totally satisfied with the sound and the fact that they stay in my ears! They are great...and I love the color of course. :)"
"382|My wife swears by these little pills.  She takes one of these along with a Cal-Mag gelcap at bedtime, and sleeps like a baby."
"933|I was pleased with the product."
"358|Love them!"
"869|Awesome tool!!!"
"269|I have a fitness band that takes this specific battery.  It says the average battery lasts up to 4 months, so I bought this multi-pack of them to keep me fit as a fiddle.  Well, not to keep me fit, but to help me monitor my fitness level.  I opened one just last week and it was fresh and new as I wanted it to be.  These batteries sit in my desk drawer, so after about a year I will update this review to add how well the held up."
"456|Works fine, but came out of the box dented in several places. It is pretty quiet, gets nice and cold, the door seals well, and there is lots of room inside. It is a great choice for putting under your desk at work. Just don't expect it to be pretty."
"524|Fits my whirlpool model ED5VHEXTBO1. You have to run two or three gallons out to clean the carbon dust out, and to clear the burps and spudders out of the water line. Last 6-months."
"845|Exerts more force than I thought it would. Very controlled pull. Very useful"
"445|I rarely do reviews, but wanted to let people know about the deceptive marketing on this dishwasher.  We did a remodel and due to space constraints needed an 18 inch dishwasher.  We replaced a Kenmore dishwasher rated at 50 db.  The Bosch sounds like a freight train in our kitchen compared to the Kenmore.  We couldn't tell the Kenmore was on, but with the Bosch we can't run it when we are home.  It drowns out the TV and forget about getting any sleep when it is running (the bedroom is on one side of the kitchen and the living room on the other).  Whoever rated this at 46 db must be hard of hearing.<br /><br />The plus side is that it has great features and cleans well.  The only other negative is that door doesn't let you prop it open.  I like to open it a couple inches after it is done to let the dishes dry thoroughly.  The Kenmore would stay in any partially open position, but the Bosch is basically full open or closed and there is no way to adjust the tension on the spring to operate the door."
"115|Great product."
"815|Many thanks for this fine product. Works as advertised."
"770|This case is perfect for camping. It easily holds my Note 3 and my girlfriends iPhone 5s (both with slim cases on). The light function awesome and even on low I was able to see easily at our campsite.<br />I was able to test the water tight seal and it held up perfectly well.<br />The only things that I wish were different is the material it is made from (it is durable hard plastic, but I prefer the rubbery soft plastic like some of their other cases) and that the case doesn't float the best when loaded.<br /><br />Highly recommend this case to anyone, very versatile!"
"765|The helmet fit my average sized adult female head perfectly. It adjusts larger and smaller. I think it would probably fit my 10-year-old without difficulty as well. It's comfortable and vents well. Hopefully it will keep my head safe in an accident."
"515|The door sticks for some reason, making the fridge move every time I try to open it."
"278|Delivered as promised."
"365|Good product but a little difficult to fill."
"533|fan can run loud. But man... It's nice, does its job and was very easy to install."
"170|My wife loves her new head phones."
"216|Great price, on time delivery."
"728|The mask is excellent.  It did fog up initially but after rinsing it in shampoo, it went away.  I liked the semi dry snorkel and worked a lot better than the cheap rental ones."
"782|its big"
"816|geart product :) super comfy I don't know why people complain about it being too tight or not doing the job, unless they are aliens and have egg shaped heads it fits fine i wore it for 4-6 hours and didn't even notice it :), and this is on top of the fact that I wear glasses and I have a larger than average head size, and for sound isolation its wonderful, obviously it doesn't block everything but pretty much everything and lowers the loud annoying noise to that of humming bird wings :) which is nice :) and in most cases I hear nothing or hardly anything at all  I tried them under several conditions, at home I don't hear anything from the street at all, the only thing I hear is my tinitus sadly  :( , outside what ever sounds there are are extremely muffled and very very low and I hear the vibration of my feet touching the ground louder than most other sounds, but that vibration is not a sound, its not hearing the foot steps like a sound traveling into your ear, its having the energy pass through your body kind of like hearing crunchy food, somehow that vibration travels through your body bones and makes it into the ear canal that way, and well if you can hear that over everything else, then the head phones are fantastic, tried them at school, works lovely, tested them with loud speakers and it works great, lowers the loud music very well and I added noise isolation ear plugs and together they are a dynamic duo :) of -60 DB    I heaven't used them for construction work like some reviewers claim and claim it is not satisfactory, how ever I did pass by a construction crew who were tearing up the pavement with jack hammers and hardly noticed it, in fact I kind of panicked  a bit because I wasn't sure how safe it was to come close to them since I could not hear them and I took off the headphones to compare and damn it was pretty loud without them, then on the train I saw a train worker with some massive bulky iso headphones that don't fold, and I was temped to let him know about these but he looked to be in a hurry  IN SUM, THEY'RE GREAT :) GET 2 JUST IN CASE"
"333|Love these pills for stress"
"174|after a lightening strike wiped out my old receiver along with my music streaming devices (Grace and Roku) I was looking for an all in one 2 channel receiver that would stream internet radio, play Pandora type services and stream from my 400GB music database.  After researching on line, I bought this unit.<br /><br />It arrived today.  Set up was easy. It took longer un untangle the rats nest of old wires than to set up the new unit.  I connected my wired network and started to play around.  The sound quality is excellent!  The choices of inputs are excellent as well.  The one great shortcoming is the display panel.  I cannot understand why Yamaha would put 1980's technology into this otherwise modern, high quality system.  It has a one line 13 character dot matrix display for alpha numeric messages, such as track name, station id etc.  beyond me why they cut this corner.<br /><br />What saves the day is the app.  Yamaha NP Controller allows you to pretty much do everything from your android or iOS device.  The app is smooth, fast and intuitive.  Ps: do not download the Yamaha AV Controller App as it does not apply to this unit."
"78|I was very dissapointed with the quality of the headphones they sound very low the battery dies in less then 2 hours which I find ironic because they are not even loud. The range from your phone to the actual headset is probably only like 2 feet because it disconnects everytime I got my phone in my pocket all around upset about the product especially for this price I could've bought any one of the 30 or 40 dollar headphone and it probably would've been the same or better"
"970|excellent"
"158|I like this device.  The sound is clear and it carries well.  It is so convenient to carry only this speaker.  I can use it through wi-fi or I can plug it in to my laptop and play my playlist.  It has a rechargeable battery and lets you know when the battery is low so you can plug it in and charge it. I am pleased with this purchase."
"152|I bought one of these radios from BiMart about 4 years ago without listening to it (the selection was very limited and I was in a big rush). I would not buy it again. The sound is tinny, it has no automatic shutoff (a must for me), and the station tuning knob makes a huge change with only the slightest turn of the knob; that shortcoming drives me nuts. I use it only on camping and hunting trips to receive the Weather Service weather reports and as a backup for my Sangean AM/FM portable radio (love that one). I never could get it to work with the hand crank; maybe I am not doing something right. I have several other Midland products (CB, FRS, GMRS radios) and they are all pretty good but Midland fumbled the ball with this one."
"256|The protein powder is tasty with no chalky aftertaste. Mix it with almond milk and the flavor is purely delightful.<br />The price is better than most vitamin and nutrition shops. Easy ship and quick to deliver for those without PRIME.<br />The berry flavor truly tastes like it is a bunch of berries mixing up the flow.<br />Try it out and decide for yourself."
"669|Pumps large volumes of air very quickly, I'm a bit nervous about the durability of the bump handle / shaft.  Also bought the electric pump for inflation volume, and then I use the pump for topping off at high pressure, it was very easy to do.  Great pump."
"809|Excellent"
"69|I bought this as a gift, and the recipient loves it."
"878|Super bummed.  Bought this for my 4 year old daughter and it never worked.  We tried multiple batteries so not sure what the problem was?  Haven't returned because we tore up the package trying to get it open and didn't want to have to pay for return shipping when it only cost $10.  Wouldn't buy again."
"228|I enjoy taking these much better than the big fish oil capsules"
"924|Good Product"
"466|Perfect!"
"469|Works great even in exposed weather like rain and wind. I live in the tropics in Hawaii. One con is that the zipper could be more durable. I can see it ripping after a while."
"974|GOOD TOOLS"
"430|I've had this product for one year and it's has already stopped working.  I purchased the 3-year Smart Guard protection on it which at first, attempted to find someone to come repair the issue, but instead they are just sending me an entire new wine cooler.  So, I would highly recommend purchasing the protection plan, just in case!"
"932|This knife is spectacular. I got it for my boyfriend and he is over the moon happy with it. (no seriously, he is. Sometimes I catch him just hold it and looking at it adoringly.) It is crazy sharp and the case is very high quality. In fact, everything about this knife is high quality. If you are looking for a good knife, look no further. I don't think you will find a better one than this Case knife."
"552|Good value."
"828|These worked very well for my hardwood floor project. they are comfortable and stay in place. Wore them with both long and short pants."
"678|Fit my fitbit perfectly and gave me more variety and fun choices. The clips worked well. The material is a little less comfortable than the original band but nothing too big of a deal. just a firmer material."
"28|Great space saving solution for consolidating all your DVDs!"
"958|Excellent, with good instructions"
"268|Remember Matthew 7:21"
"586|OMG my Clothes are finally getting Washed like the Good Old Days !<br />I waited for over 2 months to get this Speed Queen n it has been Worth the Wait. The  clothes are all washed in a More<br />gentle way n come out of the washer less Wrinkled - once in the dryer they are in better shape -Less wrinkles n<br />Here's a Novelty CLEANED . I threw Out into the Garbage the 4 year Old Computerized Washer with the New Govm't<br />Regulated water rationing Washing Machines .<br />This is a KEEPER !"
"830|Arrived fast, has withstood holster trauma and wears easily on the Glock 17"
"528|It works just fine.  It's less expensive than the one we had been purchasing for years!"
"895|The latch and connector don't seat well. You still have to hold the hose against the valve stem."
"628|Bought this for my wife and she loves it. It is everything she wants in a travel backpack."
"478|Great deal aaaa+"
"645|A little pricey but gets the job done.<br /><br />Would have been nice to have both units shipped with the same key.<br /><br />Auto-tensioner for fork end is a plus."
"266|Loving the efficient and simple aromatherapy device. My office is over a restaurant and it helps to keep the atmosphere clear of cooking odors!"
"680|Great product and easy to install.  Purchased for our son who started working beach lifeguard this summer and needed a bike to get around the boardwalk/ocean front.  Rack can be stored easily when not in use and can be installed in minutes.  I needed another rack to carry my bike and my wife's bike and went right back to Saris and purchased another!"
"577|We have a hard time keeping ice trays full at our lake house in the summer.  This is great. It's not silent when it's making a batch of ice but I couldn't call it loud either. The ice falling into the bin can be loud when you don't know it's going to happen.<br /><br />It's not high volume but we rarely ran out with a family of four in the summer putting ice in our drinks."
"468|Works & fits great in my Kenmore side by side."
"80|Exactly as described. The sleeves have helped to 'tidy up' by work space. Thanks!"
"377|excellent"
"370|Works great for tennis elbow. Only con is it's a bit large around for my small arm.Would be perfect if they had different size options."
"868|Perfect for my Bugout Bag.  I love it."
"428|It was everything I needed it to be"
"15|Love this small speaker with loud volume, great for the beach"
"574|For the price, this is a great little fridge for your office or dorm room. It does hold a 6pack and also can be used in the car and hot or cold settings The hot would only keep a dish warm not warm it up."
"16|works as advertised.... nothing else to really say about it"
"30|Works great, I wound up pairing this with a Sonos Connect, so I didn't have to buy the Connect.Amp.  Puts out enough sound and works amazingly."
"215|Worked Great!!  Very durable - used for over a month while my foot was healing from surgers"
"977|Works great on my OpenBuilds C-Beam cutting aluminium, used the precise bits collet set from think n tinker. Planning to get another for my OX. Its a little thinner than the bosch so you'd have to shim it or make a new holder. Inventables has a design"
"982|This is perfect to use while doing some renovation in our house.  If holds paint cans, tools, gloves, sand paper, tool boxes, etc.  It's great because it doesn't have to be cleaned off to move.  Sturdy and easy to store when not in use."
"209|These bags are magic.  I use them to line my cat boxes.  They're very tough and hold up well."
"616|We just bought this for our 9 year old son, who is on the autism spectrum. He snow skis so he is familiar with the concept, but he hadn't water skied before so we thought that we would begin with this trainer. He got up on his first try starting in shallow water. Took a second run and had another flawless start. Here's a link to a video..."
"480|Great deal aaaa+"
"774|Great Concept but the strap broke in less than 6 months. :( Once the strap breaks the light is useless. I also have Blinder 1s and Blinder Roads - those are better. The 1s straps dont break as easy, and the road's straps are replaceable."
"724|I haven't used it outside yet, but the bag is really nice. It lofts very quickly and is very comfortable. The price was awesome and it arrived right away!"
"656|Extremely bright lamp. Great for camping, power outages, looking at finite detail work, or other unlit situations. Recommended!"
"409|It works as advertised, but has poor insulation in the top. Like the 3rd shelf, it comes in handy for small/short items."
"880|Love it!"
"124|These headphones are amazing! The clarity is unreal. I would highly recommend purchasing a pair!"
"715|Awesome..my daughter loves it"
"882|No review everthing was as promised"
"186|Product is just okay! Volume level is not very good, I am used to going louder. Charge only lasts for maybe 2.5 hours of continuous use. This is my first pair of bluetooth earbuds. I feel gullible because I was going to purchase a pair for around 20$ and I thought the price point was too low so instead I purchased these. I think maybe for a tryout pair I could have gone with the 20$ pair."
"928|Bulb burned out after about 15 minutes of use over an 8 hour period. "
"855|Outstanding power drill; great quality at a great price."
"693|nice and greasy. more time will tell"
"876|It is what I needed and it works great on my shop vac. Sliding band holds it securely in place."
"197|Awesome speaker! I take it everywhere. Charge really lasts. Sound is great. Range is fantastic. If you're in the market, get this one."
"238|I bought a second set for my friend."
"479|Maytag is garbage, avoid at all costs.  Product fails with less than a year of use...  Only value you will get is the scrap value of the steel."
"150|This product worked just as advertised."

I travel a lot and am getting used to my new dentures so there are times I take my cup in the car with me filled with water ( my dentist told me to soak them in water when they are not in my mouth).

"84|[[VIDEOID:ca7421903fd1ad5c64ae1dc42a160649]] Earbuds have always been an issue for me. Mine is one of those stereotypical stories -- I can't find a pair that fits my ears well. I've tried so many types of earbuds and most of them give my ear canals some sort of fatigue. It's not that they sound bad, just that keeping them in my ears for more than 10 minutes is painful. The only ones I could tolerate were the Apple EarPods, and I have a love/hate relationship with them. Sure, they sit nicely in my ears, but them being fully open means I lose my music to the crickets of night and pelicans of day. Well, no more! I found the Flare R2A in-ear monitors, and seems my fear of earbuds is over.<br /><br />Disclaimer: This product was provided at a discounted price in exchange for an honest review.<br /><br />The R2s began their life on Kickstarter with a campaign that raised over $170,000. That's quite a lot for IEMs, which are a rather niche market. Flare is a British company that strives for excellence in sound, and hopes that the world can join them in this pursuit. Before the R2s, the company made loudspeakers, so in-ears is a bit of a different industry. I think they did a fine job of things.<br /><br />I listen to a lot of different genres of music, but mostly folk and dream pop lately. To test out the R2s, I listened to hip-hop, jazz, EDM, instrumental guitar and piano, rock, classical, and of course the aforementioned folk. They performed consistently well in every genre. They also look great.<br /><br />First, of course, the sound. These IEMs aren't active noise canceling or anything fancy, which is good because noise canceling often diminishes the sound quality. The R2s are still great for keeping outside noises to a minimum. They use the same plushy foam tips as earplugs, which makes for a comfortable and quiet listening environment. I tried them at work, in the bus, walking down a busy road, and even in a studio while recording. There's absolutely no sound leakage at all, which is great for quiet environments, and none of the quality seems to be lost when the environment is noisy.<br /><br />People sometimes rant about flat response and how it's better than everything else. Those people might be troubled by the R2s. They're warmer than most earbuds, but don't have muddy bass. The main issue with earbuds is always treble: there's way too much of it everywhere. Then Skullcandy wanted to have fun so they started adding a bunch of bass to the mix. Everything above 80Hz seemed to have been lost. The R2s have none of those problems -- highs are crisp, mids cut through well, and the lows of course deliver the much-needed punch, rather than a drone. The responsiveness of everything is very tight.<br /><br />As I said before, everything I listened to with these IEMs sounded wonderful. They revealed details in songs that I didn't know were there, while also being comfortable, affordable, and easy to use. The highs were not overbearing, but pronounced; the high-mids don't clutter the highs at all; the low-mids keep all the bass lines in check; and the lows make sure you remember that the bass drum exists without making you forget about the guitars in the mid-range. That's a great achievement. I really love the way these sound. Everything is balanced. Overall, it's a bit warm, but I would much rather it be warm than sound like tinny old Apple earbuds from the early 2000s, with their mesh and bass-less muddle.<br /><br />On to the design. These things are beautifully minimal, but aren't trying to be artistic, which is nice for a change. The earbuds themselves are black (or whatever color you chose), and the tips and cable match that. There's also a rectangular machined aluminum box that splits the stereo signal for the left and right channels. It doesn't need to be as big as it is, but it does add some pizzazz to things. Lastly, there's the 3.5mm connector, which on mine is black with two gold stripes running through it.<br /><br />I love the design, but there's one ergonomic inconsistency: The aluminum box. It looks cool, and I can see why the designer would have put it there. However, if you want to use these as a versatile pair of IEMs, you may walk with them once in a while, or just move around a bit. The latter is inevitable, and when you do choose to move around you'll hear some strange thudding sounds. That's the box attempting to defy gravity. Every time I hear this I tell myself it's cool to look at, but doesn't need to be so heavy and certainly doesn't add any special functionality. The heaviness, I suppose, adds value to the IEMs. I would just prefer it wasn't here, especially when I'm using these to perform.<br /><br />While these are \\""reference\\"" series -- at least according to the marketing by Flare -- I don't recommend using them for referencing. The R2s don't produce a completely flat sound like Sonys do. They're amazing for listening to, but not necessarily for studio work. I tried mixing a few song using them just for fun, and I noticed that most of my mixes tended to lose the low-mid range on other speakers and headphones simply because the R2s are warm. This characteristic is great when listening to music, but not for mixing/producing it.<br /><br />If you're a musician, you'll find that these are great for monitoring (and thus they are named in-ear monitors). I used them to monitor my vocals and piano while recording an entire song and they worked great. The warmth helps make things less straining on the ears, and there's not so much bass that I get a headache using them after a while. I also used these to monitor my synth and the rest of the band while playing live, and the foam tips isolated the sound very well.<br /><br />It's worth noting that since these are in-ear monitors, there is no microphone. The aluminum block in the middle of the cable just acts as a splitter -- there's no hidden microphone. At first this bugged me, because I would receive a call and forget I couldn't use these headphones to talk. After a while, I just accepted it. There's no reason for IEMs to have a microphone since there's no way for you to use it as a talkback to your band or anything. It also goes against the way that Flare built these, which is to solely focus on recreating sound accurately, not adding more sound. Bottom line: A microphone would have been useful, but there isn't one, and that shouldn't be a deal breaker.<br /><br />Here's the verdict: The R2s made me like earbuds again. I was considering the Shure SE215s, but these reign superior. Once they're in my ears, I don't feel like I need to take them out. They feel at home. Even Apple's EarPods, which \\""sit\\"" in my ears nicely, don't make me forget that I'm listening to music through small pieces of plastic in my ears. The R2s do, and they don't look ridiculous like some earbuds. My friend even told me he didn't notice I was wearing them because they're so small. That's awesome.e the design, but there's one ergonomic inconsistency: The aluminum box. It looks cool, and I can see why the designer would have put it there.

"676|Purchased this bike for my two year old son, who at the time of receiving the bike was approximately 32 inches tall.  The bike fit him perfectly with the seat post most of the way down, giving lots of room for growth.  We gave him this bike in March and I am not writing this review in August, so this review is with 5-6 months of experience with using the bike.<br /><br />The bike arrived in a relatively small box and assembly was done in 5-10 minutes.  Attached the handlebars and seat post, tighten with a provided allen wrench and done.  The bike is made of solid metal (steel maybe?), is very sturdy but not too heavy for even my toddler.  He is able to pick it up and maneuver it himself.  We have left the bike outside accidentally and the paint and bike is still like new.  A very sturdy bike, a great design and the concept of a balance bike was perfect for my son.  Once he warmed up to the idea of being on the bike, he walked while standing for the first month or so, has since learned to sit and walk and now if quickly catching onto the idea that he can control how fast he goes!!  Last month I raised the seat for the first time and he still has plenty of room to grow with this bike.  We will use this bike until he is ready to transition into a bike with pedals and no training wheels.  He'll be ready thanks to Strider!"

"665|This item is awesome. It holds temp very well if you plan on traveling with it for a long period of time.<br /><br />Overall;<br />Design is awesome.<br />Handle is tight around the body (if you have big hands/knuckles touch/rub body while holding) Not a problem though.<br />Keeps temperature very very good.<br />Quick rinse and easy to put a sink brush to do minor scrubbing.<br />Wide spout for easy fill/pour<br />Able to unlock lid and pour with one hand. (May takes a couple attempts to get this technique down)<br />Lid locks very good/tight<br />Durable build<br />Government label is on the bottom. (See local growler fill rules/state laws)<br />NO COMPLAINTS ABOUT THIS GROWLER!!!<br /><br />Quick test Note: May not be 100% accurate but just to give anyone reading an idea.<br />I poured (5) 12oz beers and left growler out for a few hours at room temp not exposed to direct sunlight while I drank from it. Drink stayed as cold as when I first poured. I did leave some of the left over beer overnight to see how it held up in the growler and the only downside was that next morning I noticed the beer did start to go flat. I understand this would happen and I just wanted to see how it would hold up. Noting surprising but I personally would recommend no longer then 24 hours in a pinch but most probably drink five beers in that time anyways. After that beer starts to go flat. Recommended average time for a growler is max 36 hours.<br />This growler is highly recommend as it is easy to hold when filled, easy to pour, not designed to drink directly from the spout but you can."

"564|Perfect replacement for our GE fridge."
"438|Worked great until it stopped working.    Twice I've had one of these go out on me.  The first time I ran it without the water turned on (my fault, but it can detect that there's no water nd it keeps running anyway -- what the hell!) and it developed a leak.  I'd had it about 30 days and the company exchanged it for me.  The 2nd time I have been using it correctly with great results for about 1 year.  Then yesterday it started making a different noise than it usually makes -- it sounded like a pump was frozen up - and there was a burning smell.  And it again developed a leak in the bottom.  Disappointed.  It's probably past the warrantee now so I'll likely just have to junk it.  Not sure if I will get another one or not as they all seem to be the same brand available on Amazon so they may all have the same quality issues."
"818|Scratches on lenses."
"418|3 of the buttons stopped working after a month of using it. It was used twice a day. Do not recommend it. go use your money for something more durable. Oh and also big plates do not fit in it."
"67|[[VIDEOID:3bdd17778455ef097fcffb1d018022b6]] There is a good variance in Bluetooth speakers, from physical design, extras in the box and sound quality. Not all speakers are worth your time and money. This little Cube speaker by iGadgitz is a very interesting speaker; it may be little but it has big sound and it works very well. I did find one potential issue when it comes to the range of operation that I will describe below.<br /><br />This is one of the smallest speakers I have seen and used. In spite of its size, it is a solid and hefty little speaker, weighing more than you'd expect. In my mind this is a good sign: it means that there is more to this little speaker than a cheap little speaker and a sub-par receiver. To be honest I was a little skeptical that it would put out good sound when I first saw this speaker. It has pleasantly surprised me (more on that shortly).<br /><br />This speaker pairs and connects very easily. When it is in discoverable mode it identifies itself as \\""Xquare 2\\"". I had no issue with it pairing to my phone and once connected it remained connected without issue.<br /><br />The range on this speaker is good and I have been able to carry it from the source to a distance between 20' - 30' before it began to stutter or cut out. I have seen speakers that have more range but the majority of them fall into this threshold. Now, that said I need to mention an issue that came up in testing that should be kept in mind. If the speaker is sitting such that the switch and controls are facing down (that is, the control side is on the flat surface where it is sitting) the range is cut very dramatically. With the speaker sitting that way the range dropped to about 6' before it started cutting out. It did not seem to matter if it was the speaker that was moving away from the source or the other way around.<br /><br />I loaded up some music and played it through this speaker and was pleased with the outcome. The speaker has no problem with playing at higher volume, without distortion or \\""washing out\\"". The profile is very good too - the bass is strong and slightly elevated but not overkill, the midrange is very good and the music has depth as a result, and the highs are bright and crisp. For such a small speaker, this one produces better-than-expected sound.<br /><br />This is one of my favorite Bluetooth speakers. It is very small but it has excellent sound and is made very well. The size makes it placeable in areas where other speakers are too bulky to fit. This speaker proves that smaller speakers can have great sound and it's worth its asking price.<br /><br />Disclaimer: I was provided a sample of this product in exchange for a fair, honest and thorough review. Even though I received this product at no cost I have rated and reviewed this product without bias, based solely on my experience with it.er volume, without distortion or \\""washing out\\"".

In general I feel like doing things again I cannot say enough about their tumeric."

"224|Amazing as always."
"684|Works great for inflating tubes. Makes the work easy for light, quick, ready to go fun!"
"675|This item is outstanding, well made and robust. I use this for separating stainless steel pins from rifle and pistol brass in a wet cleaning process. The classifier is filled with 10 pounds of stainless steel pins and 15 pounds of rifle/ pistol brass. It is held up without giving way as cheaper models have. Purchase with confidence, you won't be disappointed."

"932|This knife is spectacular. I got it for my boyfriend and he is over the moon happy with it. (no seriously, he is. Sometimes I catch him just hold it and looking at it adoringly.) It is crazy sharp and the case is very high quality. In fact, everything about this knife is high quality. If you are looking for a good knife, look no further. I don't think you will find a better one than this Case knife."
"60|Junk - will play MP3, but not WMA, even though the instructions it comes with says it will.  When you try to play WMA, you get &#34;FORMAT ERROR!&#34;.  My wife bought for a birthday present, by the time I opened it, I can no longer return it.  Instructions do not match player, menu, like everyone else said, is not intuitive.  To select something, you push &#34;Menu&#34;, when you would expect to push the button in the middle.  Aggravated with this player AND Amazon!"
"76|I'm really not qualified to review headphones, but some members on head-fi gave them really good reviews and so far they're the best I've had or used.<br />They're extremely clear, and while somewhat lacking on bass, you still feel and hear it it's just not overpowering. Listening to these headphones is akin to the experience of eating Dark Chocolate."
"364|I use this to diffuse essential oil to help with my allergies at night. It looks nice sitting on my bedside table. It does seem a little inconsistent with how long it lasts, which might just have to do with the humidity in my room. Sometimes I can get more than two nights out of a single filling. Other times it's just one night. But it's always been at least one night.<br /><br />I'm sure it varies depending on the quality of oils you use, so I don't want to knock this product since I'm not certain if it's the reason, but I did notice that the scent of the oil is only noticeable for the first few hours. The steam does last all night though so that's good! It's not much steam though, so if you're hoping to use this also as a humidifier I don't think it would work very well.<br /><br />I have two main complaints with this. The first is removing the lid to refill it. I have pretty severe repetitive motion injuries and some nights after a hard day at work I can't quite grip it well enough to open it. It's a pretty wide smooth surface you have to grip to twist it open. And it's not the easiest to put back on either. So if anyone has an injury or illness that makes it difficult to open jars or anything then this will probably give you some issues as well. The second issue I have is the lights under the buttons are crazy bright! I like sleeping in dark, as dark as possible. I put electrical tape over the buttons which helped. But the light still reflects a little bit up through the white top. It's not unbearable, but I'd prefer if there was some way to keep it from lighting up at all. Take note, I'm not talking about the light feature because that can be turned off. I'm talking about the light built into the buttons to signal different things (like whether it's on or not) that can't be turned off."
"725|So easy to inflat, very comfortable and easy to deflate. I had a full house of company and this was just perfect to add a bed in my TV room. My guests were very happy with the sleep accommodations!"

"373|Best general sports tape you can buy.  I have used several other brands but always come back to thie Johnson & Johnson Coach tape because of it's durability and ease of use.  Make sure you but it into 6-9 inch pieces instead of just wrapping a large amount around your ankle, knee, wrist, etc.  That way you can adjust the tightness more accurately and not affect your circulation."
"838|2nd one I have owned. great!!"
"455|I bought this to repair our KitchenAid blender, model KSB5WH4. I could have purchased the part from several suppliers ranging in price from $4.86 to $9 and most charged a little more for shipping. This part from Amazon does seem to be the same factory certified part as described and the package says &#34;made in US&#34; which is nice. Very easy replacement.<br /><br />The coupler on our blender broke apart, that is, the hard, black rubber part broke apart and so only the metal core/insert remained on the blender. I read a few online instructions on replacement and then watched a few youtube videos showing the replacement. Instructions are included with this part and includes a few photos. removal of the old coupler is even easier than the youtube videos show.<br /><br />The coupler core appears to be made of aluminum and is screwed onto a hardened steel shaft. The instructions require you to insert a flat screw driver under the old coupler and just pry it up a few times, rotating your position until it comes off. Because the coupler core is aluminum, it's really just prying the threads up which give way to the harder steel. Once off, you remove any bits of aluminum threads that came off. Then simply screw the new coupler onto the threaded shaft. You can and just need to hand tighten it, counter clockwise. The normal blending motion/direction tightens the coupler further. It literally took me all of 90 seconds to complete the whole replacement."

"973|Unfortunately I had to sharpen the punch's I needed.  The first holes I tried to punch tore the gasket material.  Once I sharpened them it worked ok.  I would definitely shop around before making a decision if you need some good punch's.  These will do until I can get a good quality set."
"704|great"
"173|good product good seller"
"860|Useful little items to have around. Mine came with clips, but they got lost in no time. The ruler itself still has a variety of divisions of inches/cm though, which makes doing arbitrary conversions and comparisons much easier. A worthy addition to the tool drawer."
"397|the great thing about these capsules is the content rrr soooo good for us<br />im very glad they rrr available"
"535|Viking should be ashamed of marketing such a poor performing product.  The most powerful motor on the market is useless because the ram only travels 6 inches before returning.  You will find yourself pushing trash down by hand to fit additional trash into the bin.  Yuck!  To add insult to injury, the bin does not use a standard size bag.  You have to purchase expensive ones from Viking.  Viking is clearly not the quality brand name it use to be.  The only thing worse than this compactor is the customer service deptartment all the way up the chain to the regional sales manager. Beware!  If you buy this product, you are stuck with it!"

"948|I'll give it 4 stars because it works just fine and I haven't found anything better."
"773|the originals. (right? or was that croakies?) Anyway - these are really great, and fit my Oakley gascans well. they slip on the larger frames easily, and stay stuck on really well. The strap is really comfortable, and roomy enough to hang down out of the way when you slip your glasses off. they are seemingly very durable and well made, and I expect to have these for many years to come."
"504|worked"
"618|This is the best item I  have purchased for camping. I was recently camping for 2 weeks and this shower was perfect. It allowed me to take a hot shower everyday. I charged it once or twice when I used my car. When charged the pump work well. It never died on me. Some people said it didn't hold a charge. WRONG!!! When I got home a put it in a pot of water to discharge it and it ran for almost 20 minutes.<br />When camping, I never took a 20 minute shower but several 5-6 minute showers almost daily. I definitely recommend this item for all campers."
"255|Love these gloves"
"769|I bought these to save money on a second pair of bike shorts. This was a waste of money, there might as well be no padding in these. They are super tight around the thighs and don't stay in place. This is just not something you can skimp on."
"537|Great product with a speedy delivery. Thank you"
"597|I LOVE this machine. Took a few tries to figure it out and you can't put a lot in it. I just  love it."
"169|Fell apart"
"337|excellent"
"332|Great carrier oil. I use it alone to massage my scalp and my boyfriend scalp. I use it on days where my scalp feels too dry/stripped. My boyfriend had horrendous dry scalp (snowflakes all over his shirt and in his hair :/). I massaged this and occasionally tea tree oil in his hair every night for a few days, and it really cleared his flakes up! The tea tree oil helped, but this alone would be fine. I read it jojoba oil/wax is one of the closest substrates to human sebum (which our skin and scalp produce that make it oily). Seems to work that way. His scalp is realllllly dry and his hair is so thick it just kinda lays there (he can go like...5 days without washing his hair). So I apply very liberally throughout his whole scalp. Seems to do the trick! He loves how it makes his hair more manageable and actually &#34;do something&#34; (his words).<br /><br />Really great moisturizer too. I think it'll come in handy in the cold, windy winters here where it is hard to retain moisture. I think it would feel wonderful warmed up and massaged into the scalp or body :)."
"997|should have bought this years ago.  Keeps bikes orderly instead of leaning up against each other in garage.<br />perfect."
"573|Awesome"
"93|I ordered one, Loved it.  So I  gave the first one to my husband who was traveling for a month and ordered another for myself......wouldn't turn on after charging.  Returned for another one...same problem.  GRRRRRR!"
"409|It works as advertised, but has poor insulation in the top. Like the 3rd shelf, it comes in handy for small/short items."
"24|great product, great service."
"65|Solid product no complaints."
"293|Smells great!"
"937|GREAT TOOL!"
"875|Awesome"
"307|These are not 7 gallon bags. These bags are too thin. Do not waste your money."
"624|used it once and it worked fine. the next time I went to use it, it wouldn't charge. at all. completely broken and will have to be trashed. only has a 30 day return policy so it's a waste. do not recommend."
"569|worked perfect at my maytag"
"609|I am so glad I bought this lifter over the other. The red grip on the top and handle are great. This holds the lid very sturdy when lifting. Seems to be a very solid construction."
"638|I fly with this thing."
"764|Very sturdy pump."
"507|We purchased this last December and had it installed in February for our kitchen remodel. I was getting frustrated with trying to keep it clean.it was beginning to look like a 10 year old stove. Then  I used Bar Keepers Friend on it and it now looks brand new! Burners are good, some pans slide on the grate, but you get used to it. If you are looking for down draft gas stove top, this one fills the bill."
"969|For a naturist, mosquitos are definitely a problem! This zapper is great - sturdy, large zapper area is quite effective. The positive reviews given by others were very helpful in deciding to get this one, and proved valid."
"38|We bought this for my daughter for her birthday in July.  She turned 13.  She played it 3 times with the new albums she got for her birthday.  She went to listen to some more new albums she bought and it didn't work.  The turntable would not turn!!!  I went to replace this item and I was literally 5 days from the last chance date that I had to return this item.  Not happy at all.  Now she is upset!!!"
"667|They work pretty good as along as my son doesn't pull them off.  Very good for him when out in the sun."
"879|This is a truly excellent router.  I bought it used through Amazon.  I'm knocking it one star because the Amazon shipper did an awful job of packing this item.  Systainer handle was detached, T Lock detached,  systainer lay out picture shredded, internal  moulded foam padding broken. (This may sound picky, but working systainer boxes make organizing and transporting tools much easier.)  The router however is top notch.  Dust collection is superior to all other routers I have (and I have many).  Handling is also excellent,  this machine is heavy but its weight seems to improve control.  Very powerful, just as a test I installed a 3.25&#34; raised panel profile bit, no problem with control and produced an smooth edge.  Also the plunge lock feature allows for fast precision adjustments to depth.  If you use a router often and can handle the cost, this one's a good choice.  The accessory kit is also costly but almost a necessity."
"135|As described. Just what I wanted"
"884|This is my third purchase of this base.  Their customer service is excellent.  I had a mis-threaded axle bolt and nut and one phone call got it in the mail to me. This was the first material issue I have had with them.<br /><br />The bases themselves are rigid and easily adjustable. However you do have to really think about how to affix your tool to the base.  Figuring out how to attach the tool to a 3/4 inch plywood sheet is easy but then attaching the sheet tightly to the base takes some thought.  Each tool required a different configuration because no two had the same bolt down arrangement. The provided hole in the corners does not lend itself well to many of my tools, but oversizing the base addressed the issue."
"935|Nice addition to my map kit"
"31|Excellent product, performs as advertised.  Receive, read instructions, connect to your audio system with included cables, sync to your Bluetooth device (iPhone 4S), play music, enjoy!  Thank you, enough said."
"522|DOESN'T WORK.  Noticed right after 90 day warranty expired that it had quite working. I would NOT recommend!"
"296|This works very well for my arthritis pain.  I can take it in the evening without worrying that it will keep me from sleeping"
"698|Don't let the sheets sit empty after you purchase them. We bought a bunch of sheets for 2 homes. At one home we let them sit unfilled for a couple of years and they no longer will fill completely. No matter how much squeezing we did in warm water, they won't fill. Apparently there's a shelf life to the permeable layer.<br /><br />Otherwise, great product."
"473|I love this machine! and the matching dryer too!<br /><br />Ok to set the record straight. About 4 years ago I fell for the &#34;all about being green front loader&#34;.  I bought an LG Front loader...It has been one of the most miserable 4 years of doing laundry imaginable. I would have never expected such an absolute nightmare. My laundry room has been stacked sky high with clothes that stink so bad that I would have to re-wash them four or five times until they were even wearable. I tried everything, I called the manufacture and begged for guidance! After multiple washings, I would resort to filling the bathtub and soaking all of the dark clothes. I even turned to using bleach - which I haven't used in decades. I couldn't take it anymore. I bought the Speed Queen AYN412 and the matching Dryer. I couldn't be happier with my new SPEED QUEEN I LOVE IT!. I would highly recommend this product.<br /><br />I received my new Speed Queen Washer and Dryer four days ago. It is fantastic! Yes... It looks and acts old-school. (It is true that my neighbor did kind of snicker when she saw it and even more when I told her how happy I was about my new Washer and Dryer) But I love this washer and dryer set. The clothes come out clean smelling and the towels are so fluffy! They look and feel like they have been actually washed. I know right? Imagine that! The clothes come out of the dryer warm and mostly wrinkle free. I can put in as many clothes in this machine as my old LG Front loader with no problem.  I have washed 16 loads of wash in 4 days. I have washed everything from white towels to washable delicate silk and even pantyhose.... Every load - Perfect every time! AND you might want to sit down for this... It takes 50 minutes to wash AND dry a load of laundry. Yep this working mom is very happy about that.  GOODBYE crappy - beat the heck out of the my clothes LG Front loader... Goodbye Forever - we are never never ever getting back together..... P.S. ... As far as the water savings... are you kidding? one load being washed five times only to be sent to a full bathtub doesn't look like any kind of savings to me.vings... are you kidding? one load being washed five times only to be sent to a full bathtub doesn't look like any kind of savings to me."
"973|Unfortunately I had to sharpen the punch's I needed.  The first holes I tried to punch tore the gasket material.  Once I sharpened them it worked ok.  I would definitely shop around before making a decision if you need some good punch's.  These will do until I can get a good quality set."
"572|Love it!!"
"938|Well not work with my torch"
"926|So far, so good.  Bought this for my mother to keep her tires inflated.  Tried other models that blew internal fuses.  No problems this this model so far.<br /><br />It is loud and takes much longer than a commercial model, but it is perfect to keep at home."
"143|this fits exactly i expectede."
"314|They've really improved the look of these old stand-bys and the flip cap is better. My old one cracked along the lid after many years and that's pretty common with these. I'd like to see that improved but for the price I can't complain too much."
"595|I LOVE this dishwasher!  It's so quiet we hardly know it's on.  It does a good job too!"
"429|My filter only worked for a week or Two!"
"940|Klein Great tool!!"
"12|Breaks very easily, and takes a while to load music"
"772|Great design and perfect size for everyday use."
"117|Bought Dec 6, 2014 and worked great until today... Now, the charger no longer charges and will not power the unit with the battery slide switch in OFF position. Checked the charger with a Volt Meter to be at 12.5 Vdc even with a 10 Ohm power resistor connected to it. Which means that the problem is in the Max A34. Not very easy to take apart as everything is glued with a soft glue gun. Now it is an expensive paper weight. Doubt 1 year warranty is worth anything, but will look into it. Cannot recommend this product based on this experience."
"897|Ehh. It's built cheap, but it works. It's also not as pictured. There's no loupe; it only has 4 interchangeable main lenses. I don't expect this to last a long time, but for only 8 bucks it's sure not worth worrying about or returning."
"73|So, I wouldn't have purchased this if it were not for my wife, who is infinitely frustrated with my audio setup.<br /><br />I needed something that would sit next to our TV, and be simple to use.  The fact that this has a remote is a nice bonus.  The fact that this can grab my local radio stations is a HUGE bonus - one which I didn't know it could do (does it via streaming).<br /><br />My problem is that I have this setup:<br /><br />Computer requests audio to be played from a Linux computer which uses a M2Tech Hiface to stream digital to my DAC (streamed lossless FLAC).  This then feeds into my preamp, and then amp and speakers.  To access the linux computer that runs the whole show, I have to have her use shell login to my linux host (not easy for most people, and if something goes wrong, she can't fix it).  You can then  from command line play pandora or music.<br /><br />So, those issues being stated, after plenty of research, I chose this.  I can connect this up right into my preamp, and she can use it pretty easily.  The setup was a snap, follow a few instructions, and I'm now linked up with my pandora account (I've got probably 40 stations I've been grooming for years).  Great.<br /><br />I had mistook the &#34;antenna&#34; in the product pictures for a coax hookup for an AM/FM antenna.  In fact this hookup is for the antenna to your wireless router.  Very fortunately, this nice box has the great feature of being able to pickup any radio station that streams their broadcasts (which as it turns out, is almost all of the local stations).  Not only that, but I can get stations that I would otherwise not be able to get at all (since I don't rely on an antenna, just whatever I choose to stream).  how do I get my local stations?  Simple !  you just set your location (enter your city I believe).  And it'll select the right stations for where you are.  It will also allow you to then progress outwards and grab more stations that you wouldn't otherwise be able to get with an antenna of probably any size.  I live in Baltimore, and it allows me to get stations hundreds of miles away!  Very slick!!<br /><br />The one downside to this product is that the built-in amplifier is really pretty poor quality.  However, I didn't buy this for that functionality anyway.  I only ended up using it, as my preamp crapped out, and I'm stuck using the built in amp for the time being.  It's nice that it's available, but don't think that if you have decent speakers, that you'll get very good sound quality.  You're much better off using the 'line out' and putting this into your favorite receiver or preamp, as the built in one just isn't so great, but it's functional.ith an antenna of probably any size.

"417|My wife is looking for a alkaline water machine and she told about this 4000+ machine.I doing a research online and gladly find this  M9. I call them right away and give me a good discount  and upgraded my system with no extra cost.As soon my M9 arrive it is very easy to install.I did a water test and the quality of the product exceed my expectation.I was very happy on my first M9."
"486|DANBY WAS THERE FOR US WHEN NO ONE ELSE WAS<br />#Freshmen #LonerLife"
"696|thanks for the tent!.  we have been using it every day at the beach this week in the outer banks of nc.  super easy to set up and take down.  i taught my wife how to do it in 2 mins.<br /><br />we took it as checked baggage all the way from san francisco.  it holds up well in the wind (even with the opening facing directly into 15mph with the sand bags filled).  super easy to put over your shoulder<br /><br />great for us who walk to the beach in the sf bay area with small kids..."
"122|Good sound... stays in place when running"
"286|works fantastic!!!"
"317|I have not had the  opportunity to use it yet but will be traveling to California in about twelve days so am sure it will come in handy.  Especially with my hip replacement.  Oh yes, it's very smart looking, also."
"743|An attractively designed, high quality simple backpack which is light and easily transportable. I bought it because of price to try it, and discovered I like a few more pockets for organisation, so this pack doesn't suit me and I will sell it. But make no mistake, this is a top notch pack, despite it's incredible light weight of 175 grams. Eg, the shoulder straps look like cheap mesh plastic at first glance. But pull it. It's tough and doesn't strech, right? Similarly, none of the stitching gives, and the fabric  is , well, tough.<br /><br />If this type of design suits you, then I'd recommend this pack. If it had 1 or 2 more pockets, I'd keep mine."
"140|Work great with my Jaybird headphones"
"219|Loved it"
"419|So far so good."
"195|Good Quality. Good Price."
"886|not very flexible...get what u pay for"
"717|Was weary at first buying this because of the price.  I use it Alot and works great! Plus the warranty is awesome if it does break."
"795|Good qualities and a great seller."
"96|The only batteries I buy for my DSLR Cameras."
"395|Excellent product<br />This is one if the few things I can use on my skin that doesn't cause a breakout and it leaves it so soft and refreshed"

"631|great product"
"995|Excellent product. Very easy to use"
"326|Only brand i can find without soy or soy based products"
"917|Best Allen wrench money cab buy!!!"
"498|Love the refrigerator, quiet, perfect size, love light inside.<br />Upon receiving it big  dent in the back corner. Needed for that week so I kept it, other wise I would have sent it back.<br />I read other reviews with the same issue,  I wonder it these are dented to begin with and they send them out. The company knows what a hassle it would be to return them. disappointed on packaging. Very light weight boxes. Needs better quality control..."
"126|great"
"340|Great oil, great price! My bottle dispersed a little too quickly but it was fine. I learned to be careful. This oil is a beauty must!"
"435|perfect fit"
"343|Love the Nuun's over other brands. The taste is much better."
"738|This set is a wonderful tool addition to my tool kit. I use this set every day sense I got. Just always good for on the go repairs. I used to use my leatherman multi tool for everything but now I find myself using this set more. Highly recommend this jewelers screw driver set."
"373|Best general sports tape you can buy.  I have used several other brands but always come back to thie Johnson & Johnson Coach tape because of it's durability and ease of use.  Make sure you but it into 6-9 inch pieces instead of just wrapping a large amount around your ankle, knee, wrist, etc.  That way you can adjust the tightness more accurately and not affect your circulation."
"619|I received this product at the end of June and have already had 4 of them break whereas my fitbit brand bands lasted well over a year each."
"817|very good"
"86|Battery is much improved from earlier models."
"629|I returned a pair of Roller Derby skates a bought a couple weeks ago and replaced them with these. I reviewed those also.  Save yourself money and hassle and buy these instead.<br /><br />These are amazingly great blades!  I feel like I should have paid more for them since they are so comfortable, smooth on the ground, and they don't have the crappy BOA lacing system that plagues many other K2 skates.  I guess time will tell how long these laces will hold up, but they are great so far.  The laces simply draw tight by pulling them up through the tongue.  They stay tight while skating.<br /><br />I was wanting to get a skate with 90+mm wheels (like my old K2s with the cruddy BOA lacing system) because the terrain I skate on is rocky and sandy.  I was pleasantly surprised and how when these glide over imperfect surfaces and resist rocks and debris.  I think that great shape of the skate and how well they fit your feet deserves the credit for the smooth operation.<br /><br />Ergonomically, these are far superior to the Roller Derby skates I returned and I think they are even better than my last 2 pairs of K2 skates simply because once the laces are tight, they are completely out of the way.  The toe box is well padded and a great shape for my average width feet.  The foot strap is effective and comfortable.  The ankle strap is also effective and comfortable.  When these are on your feet and laced up, you don't feel like you have a clunky contraction on your feet.  These feel like an extension of your foot.  You feel like a superhero with speed skate ability.<br /><br />I probably have 50-60 miles on them.<br /><br />Cheap at twice the price!"
"773|the originals. (right? or was that croakies?) Anyway - these are really great, and fit my Oakley gascans well. they slip on the larger frames easily, and stay stuck on really well. The strap is really comfortable, and roomy enough to hang down out of the way when you slip your glasses off. they are seemingly very durable and well made, and I expect to have these for many years to come."
"231|Raw Pancreas is a good product for the Health"
"573|Awesome"
"372|Great product!"
"169|Fell apart"
"686|Works perfectly for our short 1 mile drive to our launding area.  Well constructed and easy to install."
"298|I was very skeptical about buying dryer balls but a friend advised me that the dryer balls reduce drying time and there's no need to buy dryer sheets and it takes away static I couldn't believe it does so many things so I ended up buying them. I highly recommend these dryer balls because my gas bill from my dryer has gone down significantly"
"538|We bought this microwave 2 years ago as part of a home remodel. It was great while it worked but recently stopped working. Sharp warranty is only 1 year. For the amount of money we spent on this I would expect it to last more than 2 years."
"173|good product good seller"
"617|I have these on my anchor lines just in case I have to toss the anchor to chase down that giant catfish that is spooling my reel."
"595|I LOVE this dishwasher!  It's so quiet we hardly know it's on.  It does a good job too!"
"873|Great quality product. Well built. Does exactly what it is supposed to. Worth every penny."
"714|I bought a stowaway bike and this seat was recommended by other buyers. I got it and it provides good cushioning."
"969|For a naturist, mosquitos are definitely a problem! This zapper is great - sturdy, large zapper area is quite effective. The positive reviews given by others were very helpful in deciding to get this one, and proved valid."
"177|Product was defective but the customer service was fantastic.."
"5|The quality on these speakers is insanely good and doesn't sound muddy when adjusting bass. Very happy with these."
"98|I was unable to use them because they hurt my ears I used them for a total 30 min. and my ears felt like they were bruised."
"377|excellent"
"19|Did not last long,  Stop working within a year."
"97|Loved it"
"297|This is a Great source of antioxidants and a good supplement to help with the urinary tract infections. I use it everyday and im getting good results, its effective and inexpensive, totally recommended!"
"726|fits my 55 pound 6 year old daughter perfectly!"
"898|Too much wind allowance into eyes, make mine water when riding my motorcycle."
"114|I really enjoy the the skip and pause functions. Only things I would change is being able to adjust the volume on the speaker itself, and for it to have a better stick, had trouble getting it on the shower. But it was loud enough and easy to use. So ultimately happy with it."
"697|Extremely cheap and usefull."
"138|Trash, returned mine after 2 days. The pads are hard and very uncomfortable. It is completely plastic  and feels like it is  about to break. DONT BUY"
"217|Broke down after a month."
"540|I decided to buy this dryer and I don't regret so far.  It works great !!!!! Thank you so much."
"405|It would not cool below 55 degrees and has now stopped working all together.  I would NOT recommend this piece of junk to anyone."
"635|Excellent."
"543|Nice washer. Unfortunately, it leaked all over the floor with the first wash. I think the corrugated drainage tubing got damaged or was defective."
"922|Good tool"
"412|Did the job but didn't match the original gray wheels."
"977|Works great on my OpenBuilds C-Beam cutting aluminium, used the precise bits collet set from ron and barbara at think n tinker. Planning to get another for my OX. Its a little thinner than the bosch so you'd have to shim it or make a new holder. Inventables has a design"
"769|I bought these to save money on a second pair of bike shorts. This was a waste of money, there might as well be no padding in these. They are super tight around the thighs and don't stay in place. This is just not something you can skimp on."
"972|The pedal gets scorching hot after less than 10 minutes use, not even at full speed.  I see others are having the same problem.  I'd like to know where/how to replace the pedal with something better.  The rotary tool itself is great, but without a good pedal it's obviously useless."
"235|Love this stuff. Been using it for seven years now"
"569|worked perfect at my maytag"
"914|Work well."
"514|This is a great fridge. The sparkling water function is awesome. The counter-level drawer is a great spot for cold drinks. While it's a counter-depth, it's still pretty roomy both in the fridge and freezer.<br /><br />It would have been better if the ice maker was located on the door, but Samsung doesn't seem to do that.<br /><br />I was a little wary ordering this over the Internet, but it came in perfect condition and the delivery guys were great."
"943|Fine point for tiny jobs. Perfect!"
"795|Good qualities and a great seller."
"496|Fit as advertised.  Just make sure to run a couple gallons through it as directed."
"740|Excellent bike light, super bright strobe is visible from far away. I like the adjustable feature so I can easily change the light depending on my surroundings. The clasp is secure and the light does not wiggle around while biking. Great buy!"
"273|This  product I have used for the past 2 years when a neighbor suggested it for a 27 year old problem I had with RLS.  I hadn't slept but 1 - 2 hours a night at least 5 nights a week and then would sleep heavily  and restlessly for 2 nights.  It sure wore me  down.  When I began using this at only a teaspoon per day in water (it is pleasant) it only  took about a week or so and I have been sleeping ever since - every night.  So very thankful for that neighbor's suggestion.  I am passing on the word to others  who cannot sleep."
"777|Our summer camp in the Catskills was made brighter by Sun King. Thanks."
"497|Works as it should. Gets hot!!"
"722|Works on surprisingly large holes in bicycle tyres, it's not cheap but for tubes difficult to patch, or if you are away from tools, this makes a solid repair in most cases."
"835|Just be careful when buying them as some vendors advertise box of 12 but only ship one  Ask first before ordering.<br /><br />Remember one thing about less than 180 degree vision: anything you see wearing safety or any other glass's is that anything you see is either a threat or an opportunity  Other products that block side vision are for my world 'dangerous' .<br /><br />180 degree vision is important.  Looking cool is not why I buy them  Any time I am out mowing changing the shape of something these are what I wear to protect my eyes from the bright sun light.<br /><br />Unfortunately I learned too late how important that protection is.<br />Never go outside without them is the new rule.<br />These are so light, you know they are there but hardly feel them<br /><br />These allow almost no unfiltered light  getting to your eyes."
"369|Best things for your moistening your lips."
"205|I wear it a few times only but the fabric cover the jelly pad already broken."
"338|I did not realize when I bought this that the amount of product in it is actually quite small and you can see from the color of the capsule that it is primarily rice flour."
"195|Good Quality. Good Price."
"517|This freezer is SO small - there is barely room for anything in it. There is a 20% restocking fee and we have to pay for return shipping so we ended up just keeping it. Wasn't worth losing so much money for the return."
"322|Good stuff"
"29|This is less expensive than replacing the battery back up and also the battery fit fine."
"229|Its, perfect, thank you"
"812|I needed to cut some ceramic tile on my bathroom wall. It didn't seem to be able to go through the tile at all. With a  lot of pressure and a lot of time I finally got the job done."
"896|Good price. Fits well."
"819|It's a piece of $#!t<br /> The Ph meter is highly inaccurate.  It gave wildly different readings from the same spot in my potted plants and garden soil. Don't waste your time or money with this thing."
"577|We have a hard time keeping ice trays full at our lake house in the summer.  This is great. It's not silent when it's making a batch of ice but I couldn't call it loud either. The ice falling into the bin can be loud when you don't know it's going to happen.<br /><br />It's not high volume but we rarely ran out with a family of four in the summer putting ice in our drinks."
"673|Clean, kept a warm and a cold and storong!<br />I love it! I don't like a plastic bottles.<br />I recommend this instead buying plastic ones."
"829|I like Solaray so much!"
"612|Thanks excellent Seles man"
"995|Excellent product. Very easy to use"
"35|Appears to work just great. Used it to connect my LG 55LB6100 TV (which only had digital optical out and poor speakers in the TV), to my Onkyo 8255 receiver (RCA inputs).  I connected the FiiO USB power connect into one of the USB ports on the TV so it only powers on when the TV is on; hopefully this will help with issues I read in other reviews with it dying early from being left on and overheating."
"431|Bought this for a rental unit and now considering replacing my hood at home. EXCELLENT lighting. Fan works well too."
"605|Nice bag. Should have another strap on bottom or something to hold it securely. Also, it doesn't say that is is waterproof, but I would like to verify for anyone who is wondering, it is NOT waterproof. it rained for about 10 minutes on a ride I was on, and the entire bag was saturated and everything in it soaked."
"17|very good especially for notebooks with micro hdmi and you want to connect it to a computer screen"
"172|better than expected"
"805|Ordered for my husband's police retirement party.  Decorated the room and his chair with it.  Great conversation piece and set the tone of the room nicely."
"526|Replacement plate"
"831|Easy to breath through without fogging up my glasses"
"187|No problems with using for its intended use."
"519|I expected the water flow to be back to normal since the previous filter needed replacing and I had experienced a greater flow in the past when replacing a filter, but it did not increase at all (in fact might be more restrictive than the old filter that was overdue to be changed)."
"202|You cannot go wrong with this stuff. I use it in my laundry & my carpet steamer and also just for general cleaning in my kitchen and bathroom. I have 3 dogs and this keeps my creme colored carpets looking new. Also works great as a deodorizer in my air washer. Buy it!"
"700|They work great on my bike, and look good also.They feel sturdy enough and my only problem was that one of them got a little bend during shipping and now I'll try to make it work with my bottle . Other that that......5 stars"
"426|This is so very AWESOME!!!!!  Love it!!!!"
"962|Great stuff. Cuts cleaning time by 75% for me. Using flux core, so this gel is particularly helpful. Highly recommended."
"511|Very good item. Quick delivery."
"865|Heavy Duty"
"918|Worked great, then I forgot to take it out of my pocket before doing the laundry.  Ran through both the washer and dryer.  Still worked like when it came out of the package."
"136|Great sound quality for the price, LOVE the matte finish and no logo. Great business model and exceptional customer service."
"327|great buy"
"546|Works just like it should. No issues so far. Heavy, but simple setup. Note: keep items spread out to allow airflow or you may get a few frozen foods."
"589|Never buy Frigidaire - I bought the Fridge, Microwave and Oven.<br /><br />Two months old the oven light died.<br /><br />2 years the microwave door handle just broke off - now I must tell you that I very rarely use a microwave. Just to boil water for coffee. Can't be fixed.<br />after a couple months the plastic glass had gotten wierd and like blotchy looking.<br /><br />Fridge- I used to buy purified ice and put it into the freezer. A year after getting the fridge I had a RO system installed and had the technician set up RO water to the ice maker about 3 months later the ice maker died. No kidding. I would never encourage anyone to buy this brand. It was good money thrown away."
"939|great power pack but to large and did not fit into the case when attached to the drill"
"191|While cord was shorter than I would have liked (3 ft.), The product shipped quickly for coming from China and works fine."
"711|IT WORKED PERFECTLY!"
"113|As Advertised"
"846|Product is good, but expensive."
"26|Excellent sound. Good price. Ear pads are less expensive and non-breathable plastic and not very durable and they're somewhat uncomfortable when wearing over 1/2 hour at a sitting.<br /><br />These Sony headphones are comfortable and will last longer, but I think the sound of the monoprice headphones is slightly better.

"485|So disappointing. Like another reviewer said, you constantly have to tear this thing apart when it stops draining, to unclog the filter. Now sure how quarterS and socks and undies manage to even get in there, but it's a huge pain in the ass!! 3rd time in 2 1/2 years that I had to unclog it only to realize the pump burned out! Oh and the door has had a leak since day one but of course, the repair men say whatever they can to avoid actually fixing it. Needless to say, after 3 visits from them, washer is still broken and out of warranty. GARBAGE!"
"451|It leaks water out the door.  the carpet where it sits remains wet."
"602|3rd season using it. I only fill with water and immediately drain and air dry after every hike. I have experienced no altered taste or smells with this simple care. [Use your Nalgene for flavored water and alcohol!]<br />It's best to fill and pack first for ease in an overnight pack, but can still slide in with a full pack. I've had no issues with suction/water flow. Osprey changed the tube size to 1/4&#34;, which is a good thing as it it fits most quick change valves (mine is cut to allow for direct input from my water pump).<br /><br />The knock - the cap. You're going to have issues and it's only a question of when. The twist cap becomes stuck making it so you have to hold the blue plastic clip in order to securely twist the cap into place. I've found using olive oil (any vegetable oil will do)  on a Q-tip to lubricate the cap between the grey and blue part works well. Probably should avoid a synthetic lubricant like WD-40 unless you're feeling adventurous and are okay with your water smelling like your car's last oil change. This is where the old reservoir has it better - the cap on the old one is highly reliable.<br />Overall, it's good and would be 5-star with a better and more reliable cap (I'd prefer not having to take cautious lubricating measures every time I go on overnight trips).<br /><br />As with all resevoirs and water filtration devices, proper care is necessary. Take 3 minutes to pull it out of your pack immediately, drain, insert a paper towel, and then hang to dry. Unless of course you prefer that old musty scent. I do expect better though of Osprey with regard to the cap considering I'm not the only one who has to deal with this issue."
"119|I bought this 10 days ago. It was relatively easy to hook up. The auto-calibration took a few tries to get right, but I was pleased with the outcome. The sound was fantastic and really enhanced the viewing experience of my new Sony 4k 70&#34; television.<br /><br />Today it died. I was watching Band of Brothers, and halfway through episode 3 the sound just died. I did my own troubleshooting (I have an advanced degree in electrical engineering) and then called Sony support. They ran me through a few steps, and then escalated me to another department. After being on hold for 40 minutes, the line kicked off and said that the office I was trying to reach was closed for the day.<br /><br />So I am now 10 days into a three thousand dollar investment with Sony, and I am watching a football game with no sound while I type this.<br /><br />My receiver was a poor product. And the support line was awful.<br /><br />I am not happy."
"251|I've stopped taking acetaminophen and Ibuprofen because of reported side effects and I'm happy to have White Willow Bark. Its working great for me as a pain reliever."
"313|Bounce has always been a valuable item in my home. I use it in the dressers and in storage containers that house blankets and sheets."
"736|Really enjoyed the design, but carrying items in the bag proves to be a very uncomfortable experience. After trying it out for one day, it was clear the straps are not made for hauling every day items (i.e. a work laptop and plug) as they spread out on the shoulders and make it difficult to walk and carry. After expressing a desire to return the bag, the sellers were not accommodating and really didn't care that it wasn't working for our situation. Bottom line: the design is nice, but beware that once you try it and realize it is not a great bag for you, you are stuck with it."
"139|This had pretty good sound, but would not fit on my bike.  It requires you to have handlebars that are straight for at least the length of the speaker.  I didn't want to bend the cheap-looking clips too much, either.  However, the reason that I returned it was because it refused to charge out of the box.  Plugged in, it sounded rather nice, but that's kind of pointless for a bike speaker."
"290|Did not work gave diarrhea!"
"490|love it! looks great in my kitchen, functions well"
"146|great for iPhone cable, earbuds and plug."
"851|Works as expected."
"713|Good product, easy to use. Great size to store in bug out bag. For the money, its a great insurance policy."
"642|Easy fit and comfortable"

"346|one of the best nervine herbs I've ever used"
"242|I never thought that I would be the one to buy a Fitbit. I wanted to be the one young person who didn't have a wearable piece of technology, but when I found a Fitbit Charge HR for half price at an REI Garage Sale I couldn't pass it up.  For someone who is an avid cyclist and exercise junky I have used this little watch more than expected.  It has been such a useful tool for my health and workouts and I cannot seem to live without it now! It tracks my sleep and shows me when I have been awake/restless throughout the night and gives me goals for a good nights sleep. I like that it counts all of my steps during my day, including my rides, which has been super helpful.  The only issues I have found with my Fitbit so far is minor troubles with syncing it to my computer and phone. I just have to reset the Fitbit and it syncs right back into the system! The best part about the reset function is that it only restarts the Fitbit itself and NOT your data! :)"
"391|The product worked great! I felt alot of energy from this product during my workout, but towards the end I started to get a headache. Then after taking it a couple more times I just got a headache 20-30 minutes after taking it. Not sure what caused but had to give the product to a friend."
"787|works perfect and fast"
"842|Amazing product<br />Make sure you don't get it on your finger LOL"
"318|It did not do any good"
"913|Easy to use"
"500|This works perfect for our GE Spacesaver II microwave!  At first I thought it would be too big because it hangs out of the microwave 1/4&#34; or so but the door of the microwave accounts for that."
"118|Too expensive & reception is not great. A $10 antenna does the same job."
"339|Wish we didn't need it but it's very stable and fits well in our shower."
"485|So disappointing. Like another reviewer said, you constantly have to tear this thing apart when it stops draining, to unclog the filter.

"336|[[ASIN:B008B9HVYK Calming Synergy Blend Essential Oil- 10 ml (Lemongrass, Sweet Orange and Ylang Ylang)]]<br /><br />I have been researching essential oils for four months now, reading tons of links and blogs regarding who has the best oils.  I cannot believe the terrible comments I have seen written by woman about other companies.  I was so turned off by independent representatives bashing the competition that I turned to Amazon and found a company that I hadn't read anything about and Ordered  three oils, the calming synergy blend being one.  So far I love the oils I ordered.  I have not compared them to other Company oils so I am only speaking as To Edens Garden, but I love it."
"665|This item is awesome. It holds temp very well if you plan on traveling with it for a long period of time.<br /><br />Overall;<br />Design is awesome.<br />Handle is tight around the body (if you have big hands/knuckles touch/rub body while holding) Not a problem though.<br />Keeps temperature very very good.<br />Quick rinse and easy to put a sink brush to do minor scrubbing.<br />Wide spout for easy fill/pour<br />Able to unlock lid and pour with one hand. (May takes a couple attempts to get this technique down)<br />Lid locks very good/tight<br />Durable build<br />Government label is on the bottom. (See local growler fill rules/state laws)<br />NO COMPLAINTS ABOUT THIS GROWLER!!!<br /><br />Quick test Note: May not be 100% accurate but just to give anyone reading an idea.<br />I poured (5) 12oz beers and left growler out for a few hours at room temp not exposed to direct sunlight while I drank from it. Drink stayed as cold as when I first poured. I did leave some of the left over beer overnight to see how it held up in the growler and the only downside was that next morning I noticed the beer did start to go flat. I understand this would happen and I just wanted to see how it would hold up. Noting surprising but I personally would recommend no longer then 24 hours in a pinch but most probably drink five beers in that time anyways. After that beer starts to go flat. Recommended average time for a growler is max 36 hours.<br />This growler is highly recommend as it is easy to hold when filled, easy to pour, not designed to drink directly from the spout but you can."
"362|Always works for me..."
"690|Came in on the expected date for delivery and everything was in the box as describe.  Very satisifed"
"885|Not bad but struggles with wheel nuts if they have been over tightened. Unit is quite heavy too. Overall a nice addition to my tool kit but if i was using every day i would prefer more power for wheel nuts."
"51|Bought these a year ago and being an active traveler they have held up pretty well. Comfortable for long flights and still have 100% noise cancellation"
"789|Bottle is great for every day use also they had great customer service skills with helping out with a cap issue but it was an amazing experience love the water vault they are great and I ordered 2 more bottles for future use or gift love them thank you......water vault"
"762|I took this towel on a camping road trip, so I really needed it to perform. Did it ever! So quick drying, and so absorbent! It even towel-dries my long hair, which is something no other towel can do. My only issue was that the snap for the hanging loop came apart and fell off the towel after only one day. This loop should be sewn on to prevent this from happening. That being said, I love this towel anyway and would totally buy again."
"387|bought for my very fusee neighbor he really likes these."
"562|They work fine, now its just a matter to see how long they truly last.<br />It's difficult to place the adapter onto the top that is required for my GE refrigerator, but this has been true with any of this class of filters, even the original equipment filters."
"311|Works great. I can take it where ever I go and I always have support for my back.  I ordered a second one now I have one for home and keep the other for when I travel. You really don't need to put a lot of air in them for the support.  I am very pleased with the results."
"77|Watched a video on how to install it on YouTube and it was easy"
"651|It's ok.  The valve is a bit difficult to open but it does the job."
"300|I have taken probiotics for years changing from one to another.  I bought these because they were cheaper that what I'd been taking and they<br />seem to do as well as any others I have taken.  Probiotics have helped me so much, I have chronic inflammation and infections of the colon<br />and small intestine and try not to miss a day taking them."
"465|Quiet, but does not seem like 1000 watt power."
"162|this is worst, I test it when i got it since it arrived very very late..I charge it up within the 4 hours of charge time and tested it, it ok and then the next day it just malfunction/stop working till now..so this is just a garbage.."
"685|great item,and service"
"442|sometimes comes off, but overall, just fine"

"727|O.K. bag just came in delivered a day earlier than stated. Thank yah Amazon. Damn I live in a Nat. Forest swamp and have to travel a 100 miles round trip to git too a store. No mo, Amazon delivers to my door at better prices. Discovered Amazon later in life, sadly. LOL.<br /> The bag? Very well made solid construction. Lots of compartments, pistol compartment rugs tossed in, room for everything yah need at the range.<br /> Old bags going out, I love this one."
"877|They aren't the most comfortable pair of safeties I own, they do look the best of all my pair so that's why they do get worn some.<br /><br />However, they press on the temple and are not comfortable around the nose.  In addition, they are very easy to scratch.<br /><br />I would avoid these unless you are really in love with their looks."
"90|Sorry, this cable worked for about a week then broke. I had ordered others before and same result. My fault for thinking things would change. Thought I had gotten a bad set, but that is the rule...not the exception. I'll try the more expensives ones from Bose."
"41|Great pair of headphones for the price. If you've ever taken an overnight flight and had trouble sleeping because of the ambient noise, it's amazing what a little noise reduction can do. You can use these headphones without even plugging them in, just for the noise reduction. On the other hand, they sound pretty good as well. I found these phones comfortable enough to wear for several hours straight. All in all, a good investment in peace and quiet!"
"100|The Speaker worked great.  After about 5 months of periodic use, it would not power on.  Omaker sent me a new speaker free of charge."

"46|Cheap and good"
"246|This product does everything that it says it will do and more. I have experienced significant improvement everytime I use it. The only drawback is the price. Although it is priced much lower than all the other brain wonder supplements it is still too high for my budget, even though I would like to use it every day if possible.<br />Cris Willis"
"718|Great assist for oldsters and general walkers. I Use it almost every time I walk outdoors now."
"900|Worth the cost to use with the Dewalt Right angle Attachment."
"127|Ordered to hookup a backup camera. This thing has different connectors on each end. I had one end hook up OK but had to find and RCA male to male adapter to make the other end right. I am not sure why they thought it was OK with differences from one end to the other."

"919|good"
"591|I really was not sure about this thing when we bought it. I have to say I'm very impressed.  It is a little small but if what you need washed fits in it, it does a really good job."
"890|This is a great light!  It's very compact and fits in a shirt pocket. USB charging is quick and easy and there's no need for a special charger...use the same on you use for most of your devices!  This is also the brightest light I've ever owned, one of my colleagues now has flashlight envy.  His &#34;S-light&#34; isn't nearly as bright and it's twice the size and price.  Definitely a must have!"

"285|great love it thanks---pt"
"477|works great!"
"927|quick delivery, as described"
"527|We loved it!! Installed very easily, no leaks only remember to purge before hand to remove impurities and air in the filter.  Not having to pay the hefty GE price!! Even if GE is compatible with NFS/ANSI 56 and the Waterfall Filter meets NFS/ANSI 42 and not 56, your county water companies many times have to meet even more stringent health standards than 56.  No worry, we will purchase this filter again. Cheers &amp; good drinking!"
"936|Works great, enables me to use my 12&#34; Ridgid sliding miter saw without sawdust blowing everywhere. However, it took a call to the mfg'r to find out how this should attach to the table and a trip to the hdwe store for more nuts and bolts to get it done. The mfg'r should do a little research and provide graphics and instructions for attaching to the major miter saw table brands along with the hood. I still give it five stars because it works just fine and saves me a lot of cleanup time in my shop."
"746|Great snorkeling gear very well made and fits all sizes!"

"739|Love it"
"226|PH Test strips :))"
"690|Came in on the expected date for delivery and everything was in the box as describe.  Very satisifed"
"446|Note that this only chills to a low of 51 degrees. I probably would have bought another model had I realized this as I like my white wine in the mid-40s. However it does function well, is a very nice looking refrigerator, and I don't find it to be too loud like some other reviewers (maybe that depends on the surface on where it sits.) Also note that it only fits slim bottles of wine - anything that is a bit larger in circumference on the bottom only fits in a few of the spaces."
"719|workks very well"
"885|Not bad but struggles with wheel nuts if they have been over tightened. Unit is quite heavy too. Overall a nice addition to my tool kit but if i was using every day i would prefer more power for wheel nuts."
"277|Doesn't work at all! It's brand new and it won't start. I've changed the batteries, followed the instructions, and it just won't start at all...ever."
"241|At 55, I've used all the different razors out there. Three, four and five blades, electric, electric you can use in the shower with a &#34;goo&#34; dispenser, and disposable. Even some disposables from other countries. I decided to try the old school safety razor, and I gotta tell you, its pretty darn good. Requires a little more caution, with nice, sharp &#34;Feather&#34;-brand blades, but its a great shave. This Weishi fits nice in my hand, good balance, and just the right weight. Cleaning is so much better than with the multi-blades. Nothing gets stuck between blades, and you can open it up and really wash out the inside. I guess that sometimes old is new, and tried and true is better than newfangled. I'll probably keep the Harry's for traveling, but this is the new standard in my bathroom."
"265|nsntnttnxgntttn"
"42|Did not help my problem."

"189|Great batteries,  highly recommend them."
"389|This has to be the finest wheat grass around! The package is awesome and definitely love that I can rezip the bag. What is even better is it just needs to be in a cool dry place after opening. ya know how sometimes you have to put it in the freezer? Well this I didnt find anywhere it said it could and I also like that it doesn't expire with in the month of opening which helps me. NOw I do want to let you know, wheat grass has a very strong taste. I love to put it in my smoothies because the smoothie helps mask the taste.  I put it in my omelet once, thats a no go. ABORT MISSION!<br />I overall loved this. I also make smoothies for my daughters so this is a great way for me to incorporate veggies into her life. I do forewarn you that veggies can make you go to the bathroom so beware when you do first sart using this product that you may have poop just a l little extra."
"991|Product as advertised.  Arrived in very timely manner."
"802|We were excited to order these due to the Stanley name. We sent them back after seeing them, the quality was very poor, example, the needle nose pliers do not even touch each other to get a good grip. The wire cutters were the same and could not cut the wire due to a sizable gap between the snippers :( disappointed"
"890|This is a great light!  It's very compact and fits in a shirt pocket.

Definitely a must have!"
"490|love it! looks great in my kitchen, functions well"
"626|I really like the packaging of these microfiber towels. Each pouch (2) have a drawstring to close it. There's a small cloth for wiping sweat, and a larger towel to do yoga on. The larger mat is non- slip, and when wet it dries very quickly. I like to have wash these abs let them air dry. The pink is really pretty.  The material is kind-of thinner then I thought. But it still gets the job done. Also getting the towels back in the pouch wasnt easy . I had to refold them a few times to get it to fit. But overall I'm happy with this purchase. I received this product at a discounted price in exchange for my honest review."
"989|One of the very best tools for proper AR Upper assembly work.  Don't build an AR without one."
"791|My favorite sunblock. Smells great and works well! No burns.  Easy to apply."
"946|good"
"85|Nice sound for what it is – a small Bluetooth speaker.  Syncs easily with my iPad.  Good clear sound, decent bass.  Sounds great on talk radio stations.  Nice little unit for the price."
"587|Excellent and strong and I would recommend it"
"641|Love these for cycling and for keeping my neck warm under regular clothes.  Lasts a long time been using these for two years now.  They're going to be a regular part of my wardrobe for fall and winter."
"85|Nice sound for what it is – a small Bluetooth speaker.  Syncs easily with my iPad.  Good clear sound, decent bass.  Sounds great on talk radio stations.  Nice little unit for the price."
"111|I use this all the time now.  Works great, battery lasts a long time, great sound."
"841|These are great! I bought two; one for my toolbox and one to keep in my truck."
"518|They worked great- however, there are absolutely no instructions and they are color coded, so we researched for 3 days to figure out which one went where."
"987|It worked on all but a couple of really stuck studs, then it slipped, but aside from those couple it worked well"
"109|The rather small but I guess if I read the description better I would've noticed that."
"561|Great fun for the family, and so easy!  Makes just 1 if you want or dash off 30 or in minutes.  Jolly rancher, life savers, floss sugar, it all works great!"
"232|These were great for a time. Unfortunately I've discovered they were also causing my breakouts. Not sure which ingredient was causing it, but as soon as I gave up taking any Multivitamin, my breakouts completely stopped. Bummer for me."
"720|So cute on my retro bike!"
"406|Works awesome for apt size 110 dryer. Handles load from apt size washer just fine. It does take longer to dry. Electric cost savings over a full size 220 is worth the time. Does not add much humidity unless lint filter is full."
"833|While I did receive these gloves for free, I would not hesitate to pay full price for them. They are comfortable to use and truly functional. Most importantly the gloves keep me from slicing precious skin off my fingers. I highly recommend this product."
"404|No more running to the store for ice!  Works perfectly."
"868|Perfect for my Bugout Bag.  I love it."
"994|I use this for sorting electronics, parts, tools, motors, and 3D printer parts.  They are super useful and I keep coming back for more to keep my materials for prototyping organized.<br /><br />You can even 3D Print custom inserts for the cases if you need special sized compartments of have a specific thing you want to store!"
"22|Good product, but took a week to receive."
"301|I have carpal tunnel syndrome. I've had the release surgeries done. Either way, giving anyone a massage is a very painful experience which left me feeling very guilty whenever my husband would complain of back pain and I couldn't do much to help.<br /><br />Then we found this little guy.<br />SUPER easy grip, slides great on clothes (no wasting lotion), and best of all, no hand pain after giving a decent massage. Husband and I can finally take turns massaging EACH OTHER, not just him massaging me which is something he's learning to appreciate.<br />Great for sore backs, shoulders, necks and calves. Ergonomic and light weight.<br />Definitely recommend buying."
"456|Works fine, but came out of the box dented in several places. It is pretty quiet, gets nice and cold, the door seals well, and there is lots of room inside. It is a great choice for putting under your desk at work. Just don't expect it to be pretty."
"590|Don't understand why, but it is leaking water inside. Wish it was a little bit bigger and colder.  Good for soda only."
"827|Works great !!!"
"144|I like it"
"604|Very bad quality, clips was broken when it arrived. The plastic on top is very thin that u can squeeze it easily. The shipping took forever. Overall, wouldn't buy with this buyer"
"159|I have ordered 3 packages of these over the past few weeks and all of them have been different sizes. The first 100 fit perfectly with about 1/4&#34; overhang at the top, I like that compared to the other sleeves that usually hang 1/2&#34;-3/4&#34; over the top of the record. The second 100 I received were cut incorrectly and I couldn't even get the record inside of them. I sent those back and re-ordered, when the 3rd shipment arrived they fit perfectly but some of them are cut too short and don't even reach the top of the record.<br /><br />This would be a great product if the company had better quality control standards, as is I won't be using these in the future."
"945|This is the 3rd one I bought and all work good"
"6|Wish I could give this product more than five stars. Lifesaver."
"512|Shipped incredibly fast, easy set up, and what you see in the pictures is what you get! There was a small ding on the top of the cooler but it's hardly anything to complain about. The dual zone cooling seems to work well and despite some other reviews, my Pinot Noir bottles are able to fit without any hassle. Worst case, just take out a shelf if you have a larger bottle that won't fit.<br /><br />Really my only concern is that there is no space for a standing bottle but overall it is a sleek, affordable, compact cooler that works exactly as advertised."
"541|Unfortunately, the product does not meet my expectation. They were extremely too small for my stove. Model no. SF302EEW. Is it possible to return the item? I will have to reorder the kit with the 4 or 5 knots."
"632|This is a great laptop bag, perfect size and easy access to the laptop with opening the entire bag. I am not a fan of the shoulder strap pad included, but maybe it just need to be broken in as it's kind of bulky."
"161|Quickly located the signal and connected.  Very surprised with the sound from such a small speaker.  It's strength is in it's size - easy to move around.  Redefines portable music.  Perfect for the deck, patio and pool."
"341|Great! It helps my daughter from to pay and she appreciates them for the boys!"
"359|Excellent product. Combined with the curve pills it will do wonders. But you have to be consistent and a few workouts a week should do it. The cream smells great. And absorbs pretty quickly so you are not waiting around to dry. A little goes a long way. The pills never made me feel funny or any different. Must be stored in a cool place. Great product well continue using. 👏"
"622|This is my second time buying this system from RAD Cycle. It works very well, the price is reasonable, and opens up my garage floor. The only thing to be aware of is that the installation is not very hard, but will most likely require attaching it to a board, before it's attached to the ceiling. There is another option out there that comes with it's own board integrated in, which would make the installation just a little faster."
"27|Great Energy Level VI travel charger! Very compact and fast charging. It is the most convenient product I never seen before ! I like it. I am very happy with this seller . Order packed very well and ship fast .Great energy level VI slimmest travel charger . Courteous service !"
"261|Pen didn't write.  Had to get a new tip.  Luckily I found one on Amazon."
"461|Looks good and works quickly."
"56|Bought these headphones a week ago and I love them. These are the most comfortable headphones I've ever owned. Feels so comfortable even listening for many hours. I own a pair of Audio Technica M50x and these for me are much better. They are much more open and a pleasure to listen to any music. I listen to music mostly on my iPad and have a subscription to Tidal premium musi service right now. The clarity of the music is amazing. These headphones also are a great bargain at $108.99 on Amazon. I'm very happy with my purchase."
"941|I bought them because I have a tree business. I can still hear the chainsaws,ect. They also don't fit me well either."
"759|worked great, love not having to carry fuel canisters. Tested it at home, boiled a cup of water in under 4min. It did take considerably longer to boil water while backpacking (5500'+ elevation) mostly the problem was the breeze though since in the morning (no breeze)it heated up water quite quickly. My 24oz stanley cup barely fit with the pot holder flipped in so I've made a small bracket to hold it. I've also made a windshield from a lightweight aluminum baking sheet so we'll see if that helps. Overall though very happy with this."
"636|Easy to adjust for any height.  Exactly what I expected."
"32|Excelent purchase.  I recomendm it."
"256|The protein powder is tasty with no chalky aftertaste. Mix it with almond milk and the flavor is purely delightful.<br />The price is better than most vitamin and nutrition shops. Easy ship and quick to deliver for those without PRIME.<br />The berry flavor truly tastes like it is a bunch of berries mixing up the flow.<br />Try it out and decide for yourself."
"236|Absolutely loved them! I was a bit worried but will buy additional pairs. I use them for painting my toes so can't review about alignment but great for keeping toes apart while painting. Shallow but it's what I needed them for :)"
"344|I thought I would give this a try after using ReJuvenate. I have high hopes for this one."
"709|Used a short time, not enough space inside, the bottom liner cracked already, never happened to the others I've had with liners."
"836|It is very difficult to find decent gloves to fit a woman's hand. All women's gloves I have seen are worthy only of potting plants, not real work. I'd been using a very similar looking, small, men's leather gloves from a big-box store, but the fingers would wear out very quickly.  These have been great so far. I love the extra piece of leather on the first two fingers and the thumb, which is where the others always wore out. There is a little extra padding on the palm and knuckles. The padding may make them a little warmer than typical light-duty gloves. The side of the forefinger is reinforced as well. The construction overall is very good.  The small size fits my hands (which are med/large women's size) well, although it is a tad bit bigger than my usual brand. I am very happy so far and will follow up in time when they are used more.  Update: 5 Months later and they are holding up great. I have been doing a lot of shoveling and working with chicken wire, cement blocks and gravel. They have been used in both wet and dry situations."
"394|I have been using these vitamins for about a year now and I absolutely love them! However, there was one time when Amazon was out and I had to buy Women's One A Day. They were so aweful compared to these. These have a great natural berry flavor and a soft, easy to chew, texture."
"959|I have tried less expensive aka cheaper augers. They al were a waste of time and money. Ridgid is well designed and does the job. Do't waste your money on the cheapies it will cost you more in the long run."
"520|I love this range! I wish it had a self cleaning oven but the continuous cleaning feature does work. It has real cast iron grates witch is a big plus, The igniter feature works more like a grill, it takes some getting use to but it performs well. I have had this range for about 2 years now and I am still happy with this purchase. It fits well into my tiny craftsman bungalow kitchen."
"194|Did not work as expected, However this might be an issue with my application and not the part itself."
"227|OH, a beautiful scent, These oils are very good and scent is strong. Love it."
"410|it's not worth 22 dollars, I've heard it became of some value just not that high."
"222|Ok"
"668|Awesome helmet for my son.  He says it's the most 'comfortable' helmet he's ever tried.  Has a front visor, looks cool, can take a good beating and fits a little kid with a larger than average head."
"233|Waste of money. Not really anything to do w/ product but my daughter would not do it."
"661|This is very lightweight and a super addition to my hammock.  I rigged it with 550 cord to hang just above the hammock recently, on an off-trail overnight hike.  We got some rain and wind and I stayed high and dry.  I kept my gear with my in the hammock so nothing was no the ground to get wet.  It dried fast, stuffed easy and packed small.  Kind of pricy but I happy and have pretty much forgotten what I spent!"
"912|Good product"
"141|Great product."
"790|I've been using jockstraps and thought I'd give this a go.  Works great.  Pricy.  But they fit and feel nice."
"633|Very comfortable, bought it to use out on our deck when it's nice in the summer time, inflates in 2 minutes, super easy to use!"
"309|Easy to take tablets so you don't have to find the light switch and stumble around trying to find water or a drink to take a pill. Eases your body towards sleep and helps you fall asleep nicely. The taste is ok, no aftertaste or odd film in your mouth. A bit sweet for me."
"433|The rinse cycle leaves a lot to be desired. If you dont add too much soap works great though."
"204|We have been using this for almost a month and so far it's worked out really well! My son is actually waking up when the alarm sounds and changes his bottoms if he needs to or finishes in the bathroom! Before the alarm he wouldn't wake up for any type of noise!!! He has more gold stars on his board than silver and it has boosted his confidence! We are happy!<br />The only thing it does and we don't know why is that it will randomly sound even if he's dry.. Not sure if that's supposed to happen or not but its not too often so we just ignore it and shut it off!"
"142|Works fine for my application. Range is not the best but fine for my use"
"741|Kids are having a blast.  It does feel a bit on the heavier side after wearing shoes though.  The braking is not quite what I expected.  Kids took a very long time to figure out how to stop (even after reading instructions, it doesn't quite work as they wrote)<br /><br />I would have preferred no color / neutral colors for the lower price.  The pink color feels like terribly awkward even for my girls."
"320|I love this scent. It is too bad that Bath and Body Works discontinued it but I am pleased that I found it through Amazon. If B&BW picks it back up, I can use their coupons and save a little money too!"
"468|Works & fits great in my Kenmore side by side."
"33|Great quality for the price.  I believe they will last the entire school year.  They do not look cheezy at all."
"712|Terrific!"
"436|Arrived quickly and was easy to install"
"806|GREAT SELLER PRODUCT WORKED GREAT"
"701|Very cheap ."
"942|great tape. all my fat maxes have always lasted me like 3 years. I genraly go through some other tapes and put this one aside for awhile or so on, but ofr the most part it's my main tape messure. i do accoustic and it's perfect and the heads nice for laying out big jobs ill throw it on but for th most part that's far to large to use on the end of the tape. it stays on the tape decently, surprisenly. i make no efforts to preserve it or keep it on, it's stayed on over a week and thats impressive to me. i use my tape 400 times a day, on and off the clip. honestly best tape messure out their right now, and on a plus they've made some small improvments, easier to read lines, tapered to a podint for your inches, whitch helps, and its extra wide i can lay out in the air over 20 ft rooms if i really wanna."
"113|As Advertised"
"11|Love clock radio & CD player.  Easy to operate."
"120|These do not hold as long of a charge as the green-capped compeditors, even though the MW/hr is advertised to be higher.  However these do work as batteries and will hold a 'decent' charge, however the charge is shorter lived than other batteries of the same type I have tried.  I do use these often.  Also these did fry one of my USB ports, so use ONLY in outlet-usb ports."
"313|Bounce has always been a valuable item in my home. I use it in the dressers and in storage containers that house blankets and sheets."
"61|Our family loves to go bike riding but i get bored after a while. I got a free trial of these Taco speakers and took them along one time when i rode for a while. Put on my favorite jam and jammed out to the amazing music."
"145|I bought this as a replacement for my Verizon FIOS backup battery. The original battery lasted over three years... this one lasted 8 months. The &#34;Designed for long life: 6 - 8 years&#34; statement is a joke.<br /><br />I finally contacted the company after a week of trying (even after a year, their website listed on the battery is not working) and they offered me a replacement, however I had to ship the battery back to them first at my expense. To pay $20 to return a $23 battery for replacement is ridiculous, so their &#34;3-year replacement warranty&#34; is absolutely worthless."
"345|Great product. Great value"
"794|Sorry, the product came without any sling and i had to return it"
"920|I really like this tent.  I'm quite happy with it especially for the price.  I set it up once in my yard to learn how to do it before using it at the beach.  It worked great.<br />---Set up is pretty straight forward - simple directions. Picture directions.<br />---I used it at the beach,  it was a VERY windy day.  Well, after I set up the tent and had anchored it with the provided pins I noticed it started to lift a little with a big gust, so then I immediately filled the provided sandbags & they nicely weighted the tent down by hanging from the outer part of the tent.  Also, just for fun the kids buried the 2 bottom horizontal poles under sand & rocks the collected and we through some rocks in the bottom inner pocket of the liner.  We also out the cooler down on the bottom horizontal poles to add more weight.  After that:::zero lift, the tent was secured & worked beautifully all day.  Again, it was a very windy beach day.<br />---This tent is nice & light to carry with the shoulder strap - couple pounds only.<br />---Pretty easy dismantle just undo the corner poles then they nicely buckle down to fold.  The rest of the tent folds up rather nicely.  I got 8t back in the bag easily.<br />---This blocked a lot of sun.  It can be shifted around a bit to face the sun to block more sun. I even hung a blanket in the back for more privacy.  I didn't use sunscreen while sitting under it and got no color-I am a red head and can burn in 20 minutes.  But, I was fine under here!<br />---3 of us fit under it no problem.  We lined our towels in it and sat or laid down just like I would normally do at the beach.  Plenty of head room while sitting, but if you want to bring a chair you'd need a low beach chair not a regular chair height or you'd most likely make contact with the top.  You can't stand under this it's too low, but, who stands at the beach?<br />---I love that this tent is simple and WAY more nonchalant than most beach tents that I've seen.  I don't want a huge structure that's florescent and blocks the beach view off and is the size of a room.  No, I want simple, not too much $ and not too showy - and that what this tent is.<br />---The anchor pins are a little short (4 or 5 inches approx) for use in beach sand because the sand is so smooth that they could come out easily - they just don't go deep enough to reach the hard sand at the beach.  So I'll be buying longer pins, like 10 inch size or a foot."
"101|First off, I bought this product on sale for $25 off of Amazon. What a great deal, this bluetooth speaker is LOUD! It's got fair bass levels for the size and price point. Both front and back of the device emit sound, though front is louder. I think this gives it better quality and more range. I use this out by the pool and plan on using for fishing trips and tailgates. The only reason i did not give it 5 stars, when pressing the volume +/- the music stops for a &#34;boop&#34; noise. Also, when powering on, changing modes, or pairing a device, the speaker plays a womens voice that sounds almost comical. It's a little goofy, but at this price point who cares. This speaker is comparable to high end units of the same size, with just slightly less bass.<br /><br />Thanks Amazon!"
"745|Love my new Fitbit wrisband."
"68|My son gets 41 channels in Hickory NC. He is well pleased."
"312|working good after one year using it."
"427|The dryer for this stackable unit destroys clothes.  A loose button is found almost every time buttoned up shirts go in the dryer.  The vent holes to the lint trap are very large, and just the right size for buttons to be lodge in to be ripped off.  I have had buttons destroyed and holes ripped open when the buttons get ripped off.  All they need to do is design a replacement piece and I will get to keep my buttons."
"411|Wonderful! It spins the clothes out fast! We use this with the washing machine just like this in our camper. Great and saves money at the camp laundry.  Just wash spin and hang up."
"610|good to have"
"422|Arrived when promised, perfect fit - water tastes delicious!"
"961|ok"
"544|Looks okay, but old one was good so this was not used."
"913|Easy to use"
"742|The material quality is less durable that I was expecting based on Jansport backpacks purchased in the past.  BUT the color and print are amazing. I would purchase it again keeping in mind you get what you pay for as far as fabric quality.  The size is perfect for my 2nd grader, not too big not too small."
"804|Quality waterproofing and no issues at all."
"210|Delivered product was as expected."
"542|when we first installed the filter the water was black that came out, i am assuming from the carbon filter, but i have never had this experience from any other filters.  it eventually stopped but it should not have been black.  we have been using it for while and the water has a haze to it... not impressed so fare, won't buy again...."
"901|started leaking after a very few month and we have had to replace it"
"501|Works perfect for when I am out in my RV!"
"822|I use this holster for my Nebo 250 Lumens SLYDE LED Flashlight 190 Lumens Work Light. It adjusts fine and it won't slip out that easy. The rotating clip is great because I can aim the light and walk or work hands-free. Great price for a great product."
"656|Extremely bright lamp. Great for camping, power outages, looking at finite detail work, or other unlit situations. Recommended!"
"432|very happy with purchase.  Quiet.  Used for soft drinks."
"627|When I first bought these I was worried about the 1 star rating a saying that the pedals started creaking when relatively new. I bought them anyway and am glad that I did. After about 100 of road use one of the pedals did start to creak. All I had to do to fix it we take the axles out and make sure that the bearings were adjusted properly and repacked them with grease. I love these pedals. The only reason I didn't give them 5 stars was that I had to fiddle with them when they were basically new."
"206|Love this product and the ability to buy a case is just makes it better"
"713|Good product, easy to use. Great size to store in bug out bag. For the money, its a great insurance policy."
"545|As advertised."
"761|Great paddle at an unbeatable price.  Very well made, and super light, as advertised.  easily adjustable and will become a favorite very quickly.  Superior customer service and quick response to questions, etc, if you ever need assistance.  Would highly recommend anyone considering upgrading their aluminium paddle to going with one of these!"
"810|This little sander really worked great.  I was a little concerned because when I turn it on you can see sparks through the air vent holes in the handle.  I was thinking it might be defective, but it kept working fine sanding the parameter of an entire bedroom hardwood floor.  The electric motor brushes must need to break in?  Gave it 4 stars because of the sparks.  With the sparks I will keep it away for anything potentially combustible (IE boat bilge or oil based paints) without a lot of ventilation.  I hooked it up to my shop vac so dust was minimized."
"342|For the moment I am giving this a 5. I have sworn off ever spending another dime on appetite suppressants, so many times that I have lost count. This is the first day that I have taken them and it has been amazing to be free from cravings and hunger.  I ate a hardy breakfast and took a dose, many hours later I ate some hummus and celery, and took a dose. I ate a very reasonable dinner. No snacks in between, no cravings. Wow, could this stuff really work? I sure hope so.  ☺️"
"211|So far I've felt no change in my appetite and if anything I feel heavier, I feel bloated. I'm 5'4 and 118. Notttt going to be considering any product like this one again."
"268|Remember Matthew 7:21"
"36|Works great in Charlotte, NC. Received all the major networks crystal clear. Highly recommend :)"
"559|Truly a great cook top."
"361|Using this for the second time and I clearly feel the difference.  I feel I have clearer thought and less foggiest."
"190|Looking to replace my iPod before it completely dies. I could not deal with the UI so I returned it. meant to by the newer version of this device but I am certain that was my fault."
"390|plugged up sprayer and couldn't really get it where it was needed.  Grasshoppers don't mind it at all."
"944|Easy install. Perfect for what I needed. I just didn't need five."
"832|Great price,swift service"
"861|Excellent product unless you exceed the operating temperatures, which are ridiculously low. I tried to run this in Tucson during the summer months in 105F. The housing, being black, soaked up the sun and heated up to at least 135-140F, which rendered the laser completely inoperative (zero light emitted). Do not use this accessory for high-temperature environments as it just won't work!<br /><br />*UPDATE TO 1 STAR (NOV15)* In cold weather, this light continues to fail. The lights intermittently turn off during shooting sessions. I would not recommend this light for tactical/life and death situations."
"513|still trying to get used to it"
"606|Gave this to my son who used it while we were backpacking. He loves it."
"990|Works great ! holds a good charge for a good while"
"744|Bought this for my dad. He is very pleased with it, especially the ability to focus the light. It allows you to see for quite a distance. After seeing how the light works, would definitely consider buying more of these to have on hand around the house, in the car, camper, etc."
"856|Good tool and seems good quality"
"10|Alll good"
"509|Easy replacement"
"611|VERY difficult to set up. The muscle needed precludes senior citizens being able to finish the job without help!!"
"112|Does the job!"
"4|Works well. Bass is somewhat lacking but is present. Overall pleased with the item."
"811|This is the most fabulous tool ever!!!!  It has sped up my time on tearing down a 1950's dinette chair to recover, from two hours to about 45 minutes!  What a time saver, and it is ergonomically designed so it does not hurt your hands when you use it!  I highly recommend this tool to anyone who has to pull a lot of staples out of either a floor, or furniture, or other projects."
"594|It fits perfect! Arrived on time also."
"909|Very nice for the price."
"23|Makes a difference right out of the box. I have 4 mini usb's. One apple old<br />and one apple new style. I plugged this in and keep it hidden away with all<br />of my bluetooth speakers, headphones etc. Fantastic way to keep things<br />charged .....QUICKLY.. and out of place and organized. I like it first for making<br />me organize everything in place ..even though the super fast charge is a<br />definite plus. Comes with sticky tape to hold into place ...so it doesn't move<br />around on shelf. Very happy with purchase."
"462|Terrible Product.  I couldn't figure out why my water stopped working after a month.  I put a PUR filter in and it has been working as expected.  Not worth the cheaper price!!"
"355|The pair I received (from a different vendor) had 5 narrow fingers and no thumb. In addition, the palm was very wide (5 inches).  Totally unwearable"
"640|great sunglasses for the price..."
"563|I hesitated for a moment before I purchased this filter because it was not the official brand.<br />But the cheapie in me said give it a try.<br />It looked and felt exactly like the name brand and fit perfectly.<br />Back in business."
"870|good"
"508|Love them, but very expensive..."
"965|nothing to really say about this tool it does the job"
"864|My mistake.  These don't fit over my glasses.  Plus they are not very dark."
"0|As described."
"353|Thanks!"
"445|I rarely do reviews, but wanted to let people know about the deceptive marketing on this dishwasher.  We did a remodel and due to space constraints needed an 18 inch dishwasher.  We replaced a Kenmore dishwasher rated at 50 db.  The Bosch sounds like a freight train in our kitchen compared to the Kenmore.  We couldn't tell the Kenmore was on, but with the Bosch we can't run it when we are home.  It drowns out the TV and forget about getting any sleep when it is running (the bedroom is on one side of the kitchen and the living room on the other).  Whoever rated this at 46 db must be hard of hearing.<br /><br />The plus side is that it has great features and cleans well.  The only other negative is that door doesn't let you prop it open.  I like to open it a couple inches after it is done to let the dishes dry thoroughly.  The Kenmore would stay in any partially open position, but the Bosch is basically full open or closed and there is no way to adjust the tension on the spring to operate the door."
"546|Works just like it should. No issues so far. Heavy, but simple setup. Note: keep items spread out to allow airflow or you may get a few frozen foods."
"828|These worked very well for my hardwood floor project. they are comfortable and stay in place. Wore them with both long and short pants."
"184|It's only been in use for a few weeks but so far it works fine. It was well priced and arrived promptly."
"708|These lights work great and are very affordable. easy to put on the handle bars. I would recommend this product!"
"44|Great mounts worked perfectly for my surround sound. ....a must buy"
"825|Careful they get very hot very quickly"
"163|Have a Panasonic plasma with side inputs and this helped hide the cable perfectly. Nice tight fit in connector as well."
"482|[[ASIN:B00JCG9H0W Electrolux EI24ID50QS Built-In Dishwasher with IQ Touch Controls, 24-Inch, Stainless Steel]] This has been disappointing, to say the least. We had the dishwasher professionally installed, and ran a test cycle. A little more than half way through the cycle, it beeped and gave an error message. I called customer service number and spent two hours in the circle of hell known as voicemail carousel, cut-off, call back, runaround, &#34;try this number instead,&#34; and so on. Finally got a repairman out, twice now, and it still has not run through a complete cycle without shutting down with an error message. It has now been 3 weeks since we bought it, and nearly 2 weeks since we had it installed, and we still do not have a working dishwasher. Update: After the backordered parts were installed, it immediately sprung another leak before finishing a load of dishes. More parts have been backordered. It has now been 46 days since I ordered this, and it has never run through a cycle. Electrolux has refused to refund, but Amazon is considering making an exception to their 30 day return policy since the backordered parts kept me waiting."
"598|I had read reviews extensively before trying this filter. This filter did not work for me. It filters about half a glass of water in 10 minutes or so. Have tried to shake it and reinstall. Thought that an initial clog may eventually get cleared but 30 days down the line it's still just a trickle of water every 15 minutes.<br /><br />This might just be a defective peice but in the last 12 years I have never had such an experience with the original filtrrs. They might be a few bucks more but am going back to them."
"755|Good deal for the price and the seller did a great job!"
"62|Item as described , fast delivery"
"398|Works great... I am feeling the positive effects!"
"244|Very awesome product !! Very useful!! My package was delivered on time."
"600|GOOD VALUE"
"28|Great space saving solution for consolidating all your DVDs!"
"366|Sprayer stopped working about 6 months after purchase. It's sturdy, and I like it, but the sprayer issue is annoying. I wrote Bona. Hopefully, their customer service lives up to their reputation."
"566|Ice maker ran out of ice again today. It's just my family (of 4) under regular usage on a Sunday. Made a smoothie in the morning, iced coffees, drinking ice water, the normal stuff. It seems like it has trouble keeping up. With a fridge this expensive I expect better."
"45|I LOVE THESE HEADPHONES! I am totally satisfied with the sound and the fact that they stay in my ears! They are great...and I love the color of course. :)"
"998|Well mad, simple to use and works fast!"
"644|Exactly what i needed. Thanks!"
"712|Terrific!"
"155|Such a great option to extend those HDMI cords, instead of buying a super expensive longer cord. I connected 2 ten feet HDMI cords with one of these and i have not noticed any reduction in quality. This has allowed me to connect my PC and TV that is up on the wall."
"245|I cannot believe that after trying for over one whole year to get rid of a wart on my hand, Bazuka Extra Strength did it in one week, I am just flabbergasted! This wart was so persistent and with only 3 treatments (1 every other day for a week) it's gone completely!  I would definitely recommend this product to anyone who wants to clear up warts and/or verrucas quickly!"
"312|working good after one year using it."
"384|It's okay and better made than the Medline Wrap although isn't a stable support for hard working hands.I decided to keep it for &#34;round the house&#34;but decided to order the Mueller Fitted Brace for work to help with the carpel tunnel."
"623|Perfect, easy to install. Fits my toddlers bike perfectly."
"912|Good product"
"264|Nice price"
"844|Just ok !<br /><br />All most sent it back!"
"440|Perfect"
"64|did not support my xm radio it does not produce 12 v dc more like 8.5 v dc. they also have a no return policy go figure."
"228|I enjoy taking these much better than the big fish oil capsules"
"547|Great....."
"200|Only came with 30 pills I wish it would've came with at least 50"
"765|The helmet fit my average sized adult female head perfectly. It adjusts larger and smaller. I think it would probably fit my 10-year-old without difficulty as well. It's comfortable and vents well. Hopefully it will keep my head safe in an accident."
"270|I've been using MC for about two years. The pills, and now the cream. Trust me...if you use it as directed...it will work. I'm  one happy (2 year) customer."
"766|Followed the instructions, but the eggs just do NOT rehydrate well.  More like egg soup with chunks.  Easier to take fresh eggs."
"882|No review everthing was as promised"
"198|Fine item.  Best reception I've had since DTV became a reality several years ago.  Picked up more channels that previous antennas."
"746|Great snorkeling gear very well made and fits all sizes!"
"670|Great back support and sturdy. I've used many back supports over the past 20 years this one is very excellent. It fills well and deflates well and it rolls up to a small size, all excellent features. I would have given this product 5 stars but I would prefer a choice of colors and I also don't like the shape that much. It's a dogbone shape and I would prefer  the opposite with more support in the center of the back and a little less width. I have bought three of these in the past year because I like them so much. Also, the McKenzie back support (also very good) has similar limitations in color choice and shape. IF I could give this 4.5 stars I would but just holding back a little for color and shape."
"223|Another great product for my preventative cancer regimine"
"470|I will never hesitate to purchase the square trade protection plans.  Our Sharp AQUOS 70&#34; TV died at 13months.  Square Trade had a list of options for replacing the TV to us in 24 hours and a new TV here in our home within a week of contacting them.  This is a service organization that understands and appreciates what it means to service their customers."
"308|I was pleased with the product."
"156|Excellent for my child's dorm room"
"798|This bottle certainly makes hydration more exciting! I mostly drink plain water and it does get boring after a while, so when I saw this product I just had to try it. It makes it easy to add a variety of flavors to your water - the good all-natural way. The bottle itself is very well made, seems sturdy and it arrived well packaged, with no funky smells (a great plus!). I fill the infusing container in the morning and refill it with water multiple times during the day. I usually use cucumbers plus some fragrant like fresh mint leaves, basil or slices of ginger. I haven't tried it with fruit yet but I'm sure it would be delicious. I have received this product at a discounted price in exchange for my honest review, and I warmly recommend it. I hope they make a pitcher version too, as I would love to buy one!"
"240|Great Product, Great Price!"
"565|Great wall oven, it works as it should and meets all of my standards."
"70|More or less."
"682|It's thin and lightweight, but too expensive for me. Also, the material is TOO THIN in my opinion. The silk is so smooth though."
"512|Shipped incredibly fast, easy set up, and what you see in the pictures is what you get! There was a small ding on the top of the cooler but it's hardly anything to complain about. The dual zone cooling seems to work well and despite some other reviews, my Pinot Noir bottles are able to fit without any hassle. Worst case, just take out a shelf if you have a larger bottle that won't fit.<br /><br />Really my only concern is that there is no space for a standing bottle but overall it is a sleek, affordable, compact cooler that works exactly as advertised."
"963|Very good quality"
"753|It is not a overly well built flashlight. Its draw for me was that it is LED, cheap and large enough to put super capacitors  and a charging port. Plus I have a 6V battery to use for something else!  Not thrilled with the quality of the off/on switch.  So far it has worked if wiggled but I may have to change it out if I depend on this flashlight.<br /><br />http://www.instructables.com/id/The-EXTREMELY-EASY-VERSION-of-the-Super-Capacitor-/step2/The-Circuit/"
"956|Glad to have it. Hope to never have to use it"
"18|It does not copy CD-R s to USB as advertised. My CD's were recorded on a Sony machine and properly finalized. They copy on other machines.<br />It repeatedly shows &#34;copy protected wait&#34;.<br />None of my CD-R s are copy protected. I do want a machine that will copy my CD-R collection to USB."
"123|I am loving the product! Comfortable fit. Good sound."
"40|Best price and fast shipping. Great speaker. Very portable - nice to carry around. Try it - You'll like it!!"
"218|I think the prescription is not as advertised."
"166|When I see another component stacked on top of an amplifier, I ask myself - Do you not realize by blocking air movement, you are causing any amplifier to get many times hotter than it should. Effectively reducing it's lifespan considerably!"
"25|Great little device if you need to convert micro and mini HDMI to full hdmi and down want to buy new cables.<br />So far mine has been working great.<br />Its small in size so its easy to carry with your computer or tablet.<br />It carries audio like all HDMI cables."
"225|the wedge itself is great.. however for me, it was to high.. I kept rolling off of it.. since the 12&#34; I have purchased the 7&#34; which for me work much better. depending on the person and what height they want, these wedges are great!"
"664|very nice!"
"840|I have four other brands, This is the best."
"153|Fast shipment, easy to install - no issues so far."
"625|I bought this cover for one of my road bikes to protected it form rain and snow. It comes with  straps to make sure the wind doesn't blow it away. Great Product!"
"165|When I bought this speaker, I had one request.... I want to be able to wake up to the music of the Harry Potter Intro in mp3 with a soft wake up (volume gradually going up (which I emulated in audacity)).... Which I recommend to anyone with a relative light sleep, it really is magical.<br /><br />Anyway...the mp3 alarm is not reliable... worked fine for 3 days then doesn't start<br />I don't know if it's related to the way you previously stopped the music....unclear....<br />The screen is also way too bright (and quite small) to be used as a clock in a dark room (I put papers on top to soften it a little bit)<br /><br />I tried all buttons and buttons combinations to fix my alarm problem and nothing worked....<br />only unplug, turning off, turning back on fixed it....for one day...."
"282|Very good product , I can fell big deferent in training after 1 week of using it , the only problem with this product is that it too sweet."
"428|It was everything I needed it to be"
"523|perfect condition<br />Thank You!"
"747|Good afternoon the products have not reached this far, although I have written have not answered"
"400|What a great stove.  What a wonderful replacement for my sort of antique.  Enjoy it every day."
"862|Very good product"
"584|This filter was packaged well and easy to install."
"818|Scratches on lenses."
"756|The Garage Wall Mounted Bike Rack was easy to install and shipping was super fast!  I bought this to hang my single speed bike which I ride a lot and love the ease of being able to just walk in and store my bike.  My bike is chrome finish steel with red accents and actually I was thinking that on this rack it would look cool actually hanging inside my home rather than relegating it to the garage.  Definitely would recommend and would repurchase for other bikes."
"908|excellent weapon light for pistol with rail"
"347|These are awesome! They make cleaning the floor fun and easy. I put on music and slide around the floor. Plus they are good exercise. Everyone in my family is getting a pair of these for Christmas."
"556|I am a student in family housing. This little dryer has saved me so much time by not having to use the laundry facilities nearby. It works great. The loads can't be too big, but that isn't a problem. I can get most of the clothes for me and my two boys done in just two loads per one load of wash."
"953|I really like my Howard Leights. They are perfect."
"553|Its ok, just flimsy and cheaply made. It will definitely dry your clothes and i do enjoy the fact that it will fold up so small for storage. Pulled it out to use for the third time and its ripping apart at the seams... returning it😰😢"
"800|Very nice. Will organize my tools nicely. Pegs lock in well."
"645|A little pricey but gets the job done.<br /><br />Would have been nice to have both units shipped with the same key.<br /><br />Auto-tensioner for fork end is a plus."
"555|good product"
"628|Bought this for my wife and she loves it. It is everything she wants in a travel backpack."
"363|Received as promised"
"618|This is the best item I  have purchased for camping. I was recently camping for 2 weeks and this shower was perfect. It allowed me to take a hot shower everyday. I charged it once or twice when I used my car. When charged the pump work well. It never died on me. Some people said it didn't hold a charge. WRONG!!! When I got home a put it in a pot of water to discharge it and it ran for almost 20 minutes.<br />When camping, I never took a 20 minute shower but several 5-6 minute showers almost daily. I definitely recommend this item for all campers."
"425|Unit does not keep wine below 50 degrees, ever. Look at another product."
"662|Pocket sized with zoom lens and convenient to carry or put in bag or glove compartment.  Uses one AA Lithium battery.  The J5 Tactical is almost as bright as the J5 Tactical Pro, but about half the price.  Not Tactical quality for uniformed personnel, but a good light."
"947|This is a great flashlight!  Feels solidly built in the hand and the light output is really bright white. It comes in a polimer box (the box looks somewhat cheap but it is neat to have it for storage), it comes with a charger but it can be used with AAA bateries. The price is also great, so, I bought another one!"
"356|I have pretty severe Sjogren's Syndrome (dry eyes, nose, and mouth), and I have tried EVERYTHING.... It also doesn't help that I live in MI where the winter climates are cold & extremely dry. Every other product I have so far tried, either doesn't work at all or if it works, it only helps for about 5-10 minutes and then I have to re-apply. This product isn't a miracle, but out of everything I've tried, it seems to work the best. I especially have trouble wearing my contacts because my eyes are so dry, and this helps prolong my wear time (not by much, but I can at least sit through a movie now). Although a strange feeling that goes against every natural human reaction, I spray this onto open eyes. The directions say that it isn't necessary and that the product will still work if you close your eyes, but it lasts longer for me if I spray onto open eyes. I will definitely re-purchase this. And while this can easily fit in your purse, I do wish they'd make an even smaller one (like pocket size)."
"323|All Though the pills smell bad they are doing a good job"
"365|Good product but a little difficult to fill."
"112|Does the job!"
"444|Thank you"
"262|I ordered thieves blend to help with my teeth.  I went to the dentist and of they want to pull some teeth and put implants in my mouth,  I am determined to heal this problem with chemicals and surgery.  The thieves is taking the pain out as soon as I apply it and now in time I believe the nerves will heal themselves and balance will be restored!"
"146|great for iPhone cable, earbuds and plug."
"346|one of the best nervine herbs I've ever used"
"984|Just makes the job 100%"
"955|Ordered 5 and we love them for the price we paid! Great for camping and outdoors! Going to order some more for Emergencies!"
"966|This car charger adapter from Kssfire works great.<br />It fits perfectly into the car's cigarette lighter port. And the other end fits into the charger that I have for my headlight lamp flashlight.<br /><br />Charges quickly and completely, the LED light indicator let's you know that it's getting power --which is great for those of us with old cars, you know what I'm talking about... those out power outlets that are loose and lose connections all the time! Great price on this, works as advertised.<br /><br />I got a discount on this in exchange for my honest review."
"418|3 of the buttons stopped working after a month of using it. It was used twice a day. Do not recommend it. go use your money for something more durable. Oh and also big plates do not fit in it."
"763|This feels really comfortable. I slid taking a turn too hard at Northstar and my tires lost traction. The pad sort of helped, but it didn't hold up and pretty much ripped. Not going cheap on protective gear anymore."
"946|good"
"784|Whilst bright, it doesn't seem 4x brighter than my EA4 but does have much improved run time."
"845|Exerts more force than I thought it would. Very controlled pull. Very useful"
"147|I bought this to replace a lost neoprene case for my QC20i earbuds. This case is just ok.<br /><br />It seems very cheaply made and it's kind of hard to use because the zipper is a little stiff. If it was more expensive, I would have returned it but there's really no point (I'd get a buck or two back after return shipping)."
"423|nice"
"723|Works great."
"82|They work"
"108|Awesome product. Super fast delivery."
"923|Worked wonderfully in daughter's dorm where regular picture hooks are forbidden.  Will buy again!"
"464|but it has not been installed yet!  Very nice looking stove top!"
"823|Works better than expected!"
"7|works great"
"481|It's bigger than I thought."
"249|I have complex regional pain syndrome and I now move from my bed to my chair every day. I was putting my daily pills when I moved to the chair in a pill container lid, however the cat knocked them over one time too many.  My friend told me about these type of pill containers so I searched and found exactly what I needed and not a moment too soon. Shortly after my 2 weeks supply arrived and I filled them, I fell ill and there was no way I would have been able to have filled the next week of pills. I'm so thankful I had that 2nd week already filled. This has worked out perfectly for me - the crazy cat can't spill them, I can carry them wherever I need to. I take a lot of vitamins and supplements and they ALL fit!!!"
"778|This is by far one of the best products I have ever had. I would say that I use this beach tent in our yard on a daily basis for afternoon fun in the sun. Yesterday we had some serious winds and it did bend a bit, but that is because I forgot to tie the cords at the top. It was a tad difficult to get open in the wind, but with patience and some sly maneuvers I had it up and locked in in just a few more minutes than usual. It is important to always use the stakes or sandbags to keep the tent from blowing over. All in all I really like this product, and I love their customer service people just as much. Great product!"
"533|fan can run loud. But man... It's nice, does its job and was very easy to install."
"938|Well not work with my torch"
"585|Been nearly a year since we got this and we still love it.  Keeps everything the perfect temp.<br />Bottom row works great for larger bottles.<br />Wish it had a place you could store one sitting up if you don't finish and need to reseal<br />Can't beat the price."
"826|Easy to work with Home Flood Prevention. Thank you![[ASIN:B00035I4TQ WaterCop Wireless Flood Sensor, 2 Probes (WH200)]]"
"905|Can drill about 4 small holes and battery dies.  I don't have another working battery or battery charger currently to 100% troubleshoot the symptoms (which is why I gave 2 stars instead of one); however, after multiple times charging the battery, I consistently get about 60 seconds of operation before the battery dies again.  Would not buy again."
"94|Works great!"
"243|This 2 in 1 Scalpicin is great.  Will buy again.,"
"473|I love this machine! and the matching dryer too!<br /><br />Ok to set the record straight. About 4 years ago I fell for the &#34;all about being green front loader&#34;.  I bought an LG Front loader...It has been one of the most miserable 4 years of doing laundry imaginable. I would have never expected such an absolute nightmare. My laundry room has been stacked sky high with clothes that stink so bad that I would have to re-wash them four or five times until they were even wearable. I tried everything, I called the manufacture and begged for guidance! After multiple washings, I would resort to filling the bathtub and soaking all of the dark clothes. I even turned to using bleach - which I haven't used in decades. I couldn't take it anymore. I bought the Speed Queen AYN412 and the matching Dryer. I couldn't be happier with my new SPEED QUEEN I LOVE IT!. I would highly recommend this product.<br /><br />I received my new Speed Queen Washer and Dryer four days ago. It is fantastic! Yes... It looks and acts old-school. (It is true that my neighbor did kind of snicker when she saw it and even more when I told her how happy I was about my new Washer and Dryer) But I love this washer and dryer set. The clothes come out clean smelling and the towels are so fluffy! They look and feel like they have been actually washed. I know right? Imagine that! The clothes come out of the dryer warm and mostly wrinkle free. I can put in as many clothes in this machine as my old LG Front loader with no problem.  I have washed 16 loads of wash in 4 days. I have washed everything from white towels to washable delicate silk and even pantyhose.... Every load - Perfect every time! AND you might want to sit down for this... It takes 50 minutes to wash AND dry a load of laundry. Yep this working mom is very happy about that.  GOODBYE crappy - beat the heck out of the my clothes LG Front loader... Goodbye Forever - we are never never ever getting back together..... P.S. ... As far as the water savings... are you kidding? one load being washed five times only to be sent to a full bathtub doesn't look like any kind of savings to me.vings... are you kidding? one load being washed five times only to be sent to a full bathtub doesn't look like any kind of savings to me."
"568|TRIED TO SAVE $20, ENDED UP WITH A WATER LEAK & DAMAGE TO MY FINISHED BASEMENT CEILING.  NOW I HAVE TO DO DRI WALL REPAIR....  DO NOT BUY THIS !!!!"
"980|I put this on my Rugar Ar 556 , excellent mount and well made , very brite light and great price , recommended !"
"110|It works! I got a muscle cramp, rub it on the area nd the pain was gone within a minute."
"785|Convenient, great lighting. Will order more of this product."
"53|Love this radio. It alerts the whole family when any form of weather changes. Plus you can have one in each room."
"834|Works as expected. Some times the locking screw backs off and the adaptor comes off with the pole."
"133|You won't be disappointed. The only draw back is that you can't change out batteries"
"427|The dryer for this stackable unit destroys clothes.  A loose button is found almost every time buttoned up shirts go in the dryer.  The vent holes to the lint trap are very large, and just the right size for buttons to be lodge in to be ripped off.  I have had buttons destroyed and holes ripped open when the buttons get ripped off.  All they need to do is design a replacement piece and I will get to keep my buttons."
"554|Bever worked! Tried replacement twice and still did not do the trick! Beware of this product!"
"649|I purchased this bag partly based on other reviews, and I must say I am SOOOOO happy that I did!  This bag is fabulous.  I was looking for something that was not the standard, boring black messenger bag, and this is it!  My laptop fits perfectly - it's a Dell 14&#34;.  I was a bit concerned that one reviewer said that he/she had to slice open the laptop sleeve to get the laptop to fit, but my 14&#34; (with extended battery) fits just fine.  This bag is - in the Goldilocks sense - not too big, not too small, but just right.  It is well-designed, with lots of pockets.  It has a strap across the back that I ended up removing because I don't need it (if you ride a bike with the bag, I guess it would be helpful).  The bag is not black, but more like a charcoal color, if that makes a difference.  It can fit a water bottle, but that takes up some of the internal space because of the way the pocket is designed.  This is not a flaw, but something to note if you carry a water bottle and also want to pack more than a laptop and a few folders or a binder.  If you need to carry more than a laptop and maybe one binder or textbook, you will need a bigger bag, but if you're looking for a stylish way to transport your laptop plus a binder or book, this bag is AWESOME.  Super sturdy, well designed, cool pattern, good padding on the laptop sleeve, and some reflective trim for safety, without looking too &#34;sporty&#34;."
"81|Good for the price."
"354|These bands have done wonders for the pain in my husbands knees! The very first time he used them he walked all day without pain- in fact he forgot they were even on! The next day he forgot to put them on and his knees hurt like crazy! They are padded for comfort and have dual Velcro straps for easy and correct tightening without pinching.  He wears, as you can see in the pictures, them below his knees but since they are so adjustable I'm sure they'd work in the area of choice. Perfect size and thickness. Not hot or sweaty. No bulk under his clothing either. Great great product!  Neoprene material- quality construction. Received in exchange for my honest review   Ok so my husband has been wearing these every day and he reported that they WORK!! So much less pain- don't not know why or how but the do. In days he forgets or try's to go without them he can barely walk at the end of the day!! He's had 4 back surgeries and has constant pain down both legs, hip and knees-- these are awesome! I'll be getting more for back up!! Great great item !"
"253|It is amaizing. Took a little while to get here but It is worth It"
"694|This headlamp certainly does what I need it to.  I work on wind turbines for a living, and the low setting is great for most times when I need light in a dark area/cabinet/junction box, etc. The dial is much easier and faster to operate than a push button, especially when wearing gloves.  It also comes with a clip that's compatible with Petzl hard hats (which we use), so there's no need to buy an extra headband (or headlamp for that matter).  I can slide this one off my hard hat and onto the soft headband that came with it and get right to work. After pivoting, the light stays secure in that position, and it's ruggedly built. If you use it frequently, it does have a tendency to eat batteries - energizer ultimate lithiums lasted about 2.5 - 3 days of almost continual use.  Other than that, I'm loving this headlamp."
"180|Fairly sturdy, all metal construction, it did come with wall anchors, screws & straps to secure it upright if you need to do so. No missing parts, and the fit & finish are very good. Instructions are very basic, but it's easy tool free assembly means a 1 sheet instruction page is fine.<br /><br />As the shelves are adjustable to wherever you want them to go, you may have extra shelves leftover depending on how and where you place them on the poles.  As I migrate my DVD collection to Blu-Ray, I'll shrink the space between shelves and add the extras later.<br /><br />Overall, very pleased with this product at this price point."
"247|Best wipes ever, have tried many brands but pampers hands-down are the best"
"447|Nice unit, however, only works with what I would say is standard slim wine bottles. Any bottle that is odd size will not fit on the racks.  So, to use the fridge for varying size wine bottles you would have to remove some shelves to allow them to fit which reduces the capacity.  I'm sending mine back, which has not been a problem so far working with Amazon."
"73|So, I wouldn't have purchased this if it were not for my wife, who is infinitely frustrated with my audio setup.<br /><br />I needed something that would sit next to our TV, and be simple to use.  The fact that this has a remote is a nice bonus.  The fact that this can grab my local radio stations is a HUGE bonus - one which I didn't know it could do (does it via streaming).<br /><br />My problem is that I have this setup:<br /><br />Computer requests audio to be played from a Linux computer which uses a M2Tech Hiface to stream digital to my DAC (streamed lossless FLAC).  This then feeds into my preamp, and then amp and speakers.  To access the linux computer that runs the whole show, I have to have her use shell login to my linux host (not easy for most people, and if something goes wrong, she can't fix it).  You can then  from command line play pandora or music.<br /><br />So, those issues being stated, after plenty of research, I chose this.  I can connect this up right into my preamp, and she can use it pretty easily.  The setup was a snap, follow a few instructions, and I'm now linked up with my pandora account (I've got probably 40 stations I've been grooming for years).  Great.<br /><br />I had mistook the &#34;antenna&#34; in the product pictures for a coax hookup for an AM/FM antenna.  In fact this hookup is for the antenna to your wireless router.  Very fortunately, this nice box has the great feature of being able to pickup any radio station that streams their broadcasts (which as it turns out, is almost all of the local stations).  Not only that, but I can get stations that I would otherwise not be able to get at all (since I don't rely on an antenna, just whatever I choose to stream).  how do I get my local stations?  Simple !  you just set your location (enter your city I believe).  And it'll select the right stations for where you are.  It will also allow you to then progress outwards and grab more stations that you wouldn't otherwise be able to get with an antenna of probably any size.  I live in Baltimore, and it allows me to get stations hundreds of miles away!  Very slick!!<br /><br />The one downside to this product is that the built-in amplifier is really pretty poor quality.  However, I didn't buy this for that functionality anyway.  I only ended up using it, as my preamp crapped out, and I'm stuck using the built in amp for the time being.  It's nice that it's available, but don't think that if you have decent speakers, that you'll get very good sound quality.  You're much better off using the 'line out' and putting this into your favorite receiver or preamp, as the built in one just isn't so great, but it's functional.ith an antenna of probably any size.

"954|The real deal DeWalt batteries! If you need these, you may want to get them soon. Being NiCad batteries, you don't want them to go dead before recharging--and mine only had a small charge left in them, when they arrived. Probably remaining old stock (everything is going Li-Ion nowadays,) so it'll soon get to the point that any original DeWalt batteries you get, of this type, may have discharged completely in storage. Then the only fresh battery packs available will be the aftermarket manufacturer's."
"653|These little flashlights are great.  I actually have three of them: one for my keychain, one in my toolbox, and one I carry on my very-early-morning constitutional (my little finger fits perfectly into its ring).  I also gave one to each of my 12 grandchildren (ages 5 to  22)  for Xmas last year, though one was immediately stolen by his father.  The CR2016 batteries last a long time (if your remember to turn the light off when you're not using it, which some of my grandchildren don't) but they are a bit of a bother to replace, and they are hard to find in retail stores.  You might  want to buy the  pack of spares along with your light."
"639|We have two of these.  One went for a swim in a river.  We bought another one.  My son drinks a lot of water so he carries one of these with him every day all day.  Well, I carry it.  He drinks out of it. Just be careful if they sleep with it, know that it does leak.  All.  Night.  Long."
"49|Horrible"
"273|This  product I have used for the past 2 years when a neighbor suggested it for a 27 year old problem I had with RLS.  I hadn't slept but 1 - 2 hours a night at least 5 nights a week and then would sleep heavily  and restlessly for 2 nights.  It sure wore me  down.  When I began using this at only a teaspoon per day in water (it is pleasant) it only  took about a week or so and I have been sleeping ever since - every night.  So very thankful for that neighbor's suggestion.  I am passing on the word to others  who cannot sleep."
"239|Great cane.  I have small hands and very arthritic, but it is very comfortable."
"310|Great product! This supplement is given to Cancer patients in large doses in the UK. It actually helps reduce your risk of Cancer in the body, along with other health products.  I take 1 pill on empty stomach every morning...do your research on this supplement & you will see why doctors use it in the UK for patients with Cancer...but make sure you are buying from reputable dealer..."

"853|Bought my box from Jaxvapesupply, was delivered in a timely manner, customer service when contacting the seller was great.<br /><br />If anyone is on the fence about buying this, I would recommend it over and again, build quality on mine is good, everything works, just remember you have to buy batteries ( I would recommend samsung 18650's )"
"578|This works great! It has prevented the &#34;Oops&#34; of putting dirty into clean dishes."
"105|The turntable do not work correctly.  It was dragging!  Otherwise, the sound and other features worked well!!"
"380|Extremely smooth shave and love the trim blade.  Makes it much easier and cleaner to trim the goatee and mustache. A great combo."
"491|We have an older Samsung and the turn table plate finally cracked and broke. This replacement is the perfect fit and though pricey, it is worth it. Now the food goes round and round again when we cook in the microwave."
"294|Great product"
"626|I really like the packaging of these microfiber towels. Each pouch (2) have a drawstring to close it. There's a small cloth for wiping sweat, and a larger towel to do yoga on. The larger mat is non- slip, and when wet it dries very quickly. I like to have wash these abs let them air dry. The pink is really pretty.  The material is kind-of thinner then I thought. But it still gets the job done. Also getting the towels back in the pouch wasnt easy . I had to refold them a few times to get it to fit. But overall I'm happy with this purchase. I received this product at a discounted price in exchange for my honest review."
"338|I did not realize when I bought this that the amount of product in it is actually quite small and you can see from the color of the capsule that it is primarily rice flour."
"647|It's good And compt"
"827|Works great !!!"
"154|I put these in some VoIP/SIP Cordless Phones (Yealink). They really do hold their charge well."
"768|I hang my kayak under my deck using these wall cradles. I would recommend also buying some tie down straps as my kayak was blown off the cradles by some strong wind and took some damage while stored. Now I strap around the deck post and kayak and it sits nicely in the cradles."
"738|This set is a wonderful tool addition to my tool kit. I use this set every day sense I got. Just always good for on the go repairs. I used to use my leatherman multi tool for everything but now I find myself using this set more. Highly recommend this jewelers screw driver set."
"207|It still is itching like always. maybe a little less but it didn't fix any long term problem. Just sooth a little bit."
"538|We bought this microwave 2 years ago as part of a home remodel. It was great while it worked but recently stopped working. Sharp warranty is only 1 year. For the amount of money we spent on this I would expect it to last more than 2 years."
"385|They did not due well for me caused stomach pains and diarrhea"
"80|Exactly as described. The sleeves have helped to &#34;tidy up&#34; by work space. Thanks!"
"754|Nalgene bottles are the tank of the bottle world. My previous bottle lasted through hundreds of liters of water and survived countless drops and falls. The thing that finally did in my previous bottle was being ran over by a F150, so I can't really fault the bottle on that one."
"378|I'm not one to believe hype but I thought I'd give this product a try in preparation for the birth of my first child.<br /><br />Now I am currently 19 days postpartum, I delivered a 8lb baby boy via the help of a forcep delivery. I had several tears that were 2nd degree tears including a brutal episiotomy and severe hemorrhoids. My body was battered and bruised after 36hrs in labor and 4 hrs of pushing. I remember two days after coming home from the hospital and just crying in the shower because I had severe PTSD from L&D and also I was so wrecked in my most sensitive area that I was in constant pain.<br /><br />My care routine consisted of witch hazel diluted with water in my peribottle that I stole from the hospital (it really was my best friend after I would use the bathroom) but right next up the peribottle was this new mama bottom spray. After I would clean up with the peribottle I would spray this on and although I was so numb and swollen down there that I couldn't feel much of a cooling sensation. I loved the smell and the idea that it was helping me heal.<br /><br />More than two weeks postpartum I'm back in my feet and still using this spray which is in fact very cooling and very refreshing. I still have a long way to go in recovering down there, but this product has helped so far :)  I would gladly recommend it to any new moms out there recovering from child birth."
"426|This is so very AWESOME!!!!!  Love it!!!!"
"138|Trash, returned mine after 2 days. The pads are hard and very uncomfortable. It is completely plastic  and feels like it is  about to break. DONT BUY"
"627|When I first bought these I was worried about the 1 star rating a saying that the pedals started creaking when relatively new. I bought them anyway and am glad that I did. After about 100 of road use one of the pedals did start to creak. All I had to do to fix it we take the axles out and make sure that the bearings were adjusted properly and repacked them with grease. I love these pedals. The only reason I didn't give them 5 stars was that I had to fiddle with them when they were basically new."
"439|Very nice microwave, great price"
"933|I was pleased with the product."
"643|very strong, very light!"
"880|Love it!"
"46|Cheap and good"
"3|Did not work at all."
"178|Good quality Good Price!"
"246|This product does everything that it says it will do and more. I have experienced significant improvement everytime I use it. The only drawback is the price. Although it is priced much lower than all the other brain wonder supplements it is still too high for my budget, even though I would like to use it every day if possible.<br />Cris Willis"
"47|Hard to beat the price. They all seem to work the same and be the same quality, why pay more?"
"34|Good looking over the ear headphones that have a surprising deep bass response. I have noticed new bass notes on some of the songs I have been listening to for years. I use them at work to reduce the surrounding noise. A great value."
"234|This stuff is great. I take two a day and on capsule lasts twelve hours. I took a second one too close the previous capsule and I felt a little light-headed for a few hours. Take 12 hours apart and they dropped my blood pressure 10 to 15 points for almost the whole time.<br /><br />Of course Amazon's shipping and pricing can't be beat."
"705|It's a excellent bottle. At the first uses (5 at least) the water tastes horrible (I think due to the long time of storage and/or the excess of filter products). However, after these uses the water tastes good and you forget that you are using a filter. I recommend!"
"978|The tip broke the first use"
"43|Great product."
"634|I found a scorpion under the stove the first week I used it.  It really does make the scorpions glow!"
"26|Excellent sound. Good price. Ear pads are less expensive and non-breathable plastic and not very durable and they're somewhat uncomfortable when wearing over 1/2 hour at a sitting.<br /><br />These Sony headphones are comfortable and will last longer, but I think the sound of the monoprice headphones is slightly better.

"227|OH, a beautiful scent, These oils are very good and scent is strong. Love it."
"580|I have a frigidaire fgus2632lp which I believe this model replaced.  Mine is also a piece of junk.  Icemaker had 3 service calls in first 3 months.  I assumed the water dispenser put out chilled water but it doesn't, which sales people didn't even mention. Fridge interior cannot maintain constant temp; items toward rear(like pickles in a jar) have gotten frozen.  Items come out of fridge damp, and shelves are damp.  I will never buy any frigidaire product again.  I have bought another 2 years extended warranty(my fridge is 4 years old) and when it runs out I am replacing this piece of crap."
"403|Love my refrigerator! ! Keeps everything  cold..will recommend!"
"691|I have used this camping a few times now and it does a decent job of producing light for our tent.  I suggest reading all the specs as this is much smaller than I anticipated.  I bought one of the old version too and this is brighter (non-scientific based on trying to read using each to measure light).  You would not want to rely on this for camp site light.  For what you get and the price this is okay and I'm happy with my purchase 3.5 stars."
"494|Really love this microwave. Has the one touch settings that I wanted along with the +30 seconds button.  Its a great size for a countertop.  It can be a little noisy when it beeps as others have said."
"881|Wish I had bought one sooner. Well worth the money, thank you guyz."
"510|Outstanding looks cool."
"846|Product is good, but expensive."
"680|Great product and easy to install.  Purchased for our son who started working beach lifeguard this summer and needed a bike to get around the boardwalk/ocean front.  Rack can be stored easily when not in use and can be installed in minutes.  I needed another rack to carry my bike and my wife's bike (our son is constantly using his) and went right back to Saris and purchased another!"
"985|Part was missing. falls over even when empty. Pay more, get better quality."
"291|Great product....delivered quickly"
"480|Great deal aaaa+"
"843|Uncomfortable around nose bridge. Cheap foam coverings. Wide vents that can let all sorts of dust in. I have no clue why this is rated so highly."
"443|works great!!!!!!"
"894|Batteries perform perfectly for the few months I've had them."
"673|Clean, kept a warm and a cold and storong!<br />I love it! I don't like a plastic bottles.<br />I recommend this instead buying plastic ones."
"449|Keep everything at 55 degrees, and don't overstress it and it works great- after the first 4 weeks so we'll see."
"780|Great fit, lightweight, and keeps the bugs away."
"333|Love these pills for stress"
"646|Good bike, but the oddly shaped frame is not friendly to car carriers.  Bike is also very heavy.  Other than those two things, it is nice."
"434|They claim that it holds 52 bottles.  i could barely squeeze in about 47 and these were at a tightness to where i was concerned that i would break the wood drawers."
"681|What can I say...Great product that's why I bought 2."
"891|Old...rock hard. Absolutely useless junk. crumbles to bits"
"280|Good product. We have noticed a significant difference in the motion of knees and ankles. Motion is a whole lot better and pain significantly less since I purchased this product over a month ago. Just ordered 2nd time a couple of weeks ago."
"203|This is a good daily vitamin for men."
"226|PH Test strips :))"
"39|works as expected; well made cable."
"453|Yes, this was just what I needed to get the old washer humming again.  It did not fit the cabinet exactly, but I took a chunk of metal out of the back of the cabinet and it went in nice as pie,"
"281|I absolutely love this product. It has the best taste and most exciting flavors of all enhancers. Highly recommended."
"168|This thing kicks buttttt!"
"368|I previously gave this a mediocre review, because it seemed to give me a stomach ache when I made a carrot cake with it. I continued to use it though in smaller amounts. I haven't had the problem since, and it may just be that I at way too much all at once (frosting, etc.), or else it was the combined ingredients of the cake I ate. I love this stuff. It's so much like sugar and even has the mouth-feel of sugar. I always feel like I'm cheating when I eat it, but I don't get any weight gain or blood sugar surges. I love stevia too, but it's only good in certain things. Swerve is great in everything. I've served it to people without telling them it wasn't sugar, and no one knew the difference. About to order more now. Yum! :P<br /><br />PREVIOUS REVIEW:<br />Love the taste of this stuff, and it would probably be ok in small amounts, but after making a frosted carrot cake using Swerve, I found then it caused quite a bit of nausea. The feeling is similar to what it feels like when you eat way too much sugar. Yet when I tested my blood sugar, it hadn't gone up. Both my boyfriend and I experienced this on both occasions after eating a piece of cake made with this sweetener. The cake taste great, but I won't be buying this again."
"910|Wow - these things work! At least so far. Getting used to the screen in front of my eyes didn't take anytime...I really like these for most of the time I need safety glasses."
"849|Seems fine"
"847|very nice tape!! This was my comment right after I got the tape. After about 3 months of daily use it started to retract all of the time. I contacted Amazon to see if I could make an adjustment to fix it. They said that was not possible but would send me a new one. I thought that was great until the replacement had the same issues within a few months. Bottom line it appears these are not make very durable."
"446|Note that this only chills to a low of 51 degrees. I probably would have bought another model had I realized this as I like my white wine in the mid-40s. However it does function well, is a very nice looking refrigerator, and I don't find it to be too loud like some other reviewers (maybe that depends on the surface on where it sits.) Also note that it only fits slim bottles of wine - anything that is a bit larger in circumference on the bottom only fits in a few of the spaces."
"733|this nose plug does its job as i expected.  while swimming, i can breathe out, but not breathe in (water could not get into my nose, but i could blow air out of my nose, if i chose to).  i have two of these nose plugs, one for each of my two goggles, and have used these nose plugs ever since i bought them for daily swimming.  i rate this product five stars."
"968|Deadly and useful. Come on Zombies!!"
"710|Price was great and fit was very good."
"873|Great quality product. Well built. Does exactly what it is supposed to. Worth every penny."
"91|The sound quality is unbeatable.  I can't handle turning the volume as high as it can go, it is really a great system for any size room"
"407|exactly what I wanted!"
"603|poor construction as mildew keeps forming in the top cover. Needs frequent cleaning with brush into hard to reach areas. I wouldn't buy this kind again."
"27|Great Energy Level VI travel charger! Very compact and fast charging. It is the most convenient product I never seen before ! I like it. I am very happy with this seller . Order packed very well and ship fast .Great energy level VI slimmest travel charger . Courteous service !"
"185|wasnt as loud as expected"
"803|Quick delivery. Product is as advertised."
"505|I like it alot!<br /><br />Be wary though.. The old filter restricted water flow because it was clogged with sediment. This new filter might actually allow you to taste the water."
