910,Wow - these things work! At least so far. Getting used to the screen in front of my eyes didn't take anytime...I really like these for most of the time I need safety glasses.
701,Very cheap .
818,Scratches on lenses.
477,works great!
317,I have not had the  opportunity to use it yet but will be traveling to California in about twelve days so am sure it will come in handy.  Especially with my hip replacement.  Oh yes  it's very smart looking  also.
708,These lights work great and are very affordable. easy to put on the handle bars. I would recommend this product!
107,Exactly what I was looking for - an inexpensive  light set of phones for listening to Pandora on iPad
535,Viking should be ashamed of marketing such a poor performing product.  The most powerful motor on the market is useless because the ram only travels 6 inches before returning.  You will find yourself pushing trash down by hand to fit additional trash into the bin.  Yuck!  To add insult to injury  the bin does not use a standard size bag.  You have to purchase expensive ones from Viking.  Viking is clearly not the quality brand name it use to be.  The only thing worse than this compactor is the customer service deptartment all the way up the chain to the regional sales manager. Beware!  If you buy this product  you are stuck with it!
942,great tape. all my fat maxes have always lasted me like 3 years. I genraly go through some other tapes and put this one aside for awhile or so on  but ofr the most part it's my main tape messure. i do accoustic and it's perfect and the heads nice for laying out big jobs ill throw it on but for th most part that's far to large to use on the end of the tape. it stays on the tape decently  surprisenly. i make no efforts to preserve it or keep it on  it's stayed on over a week and thats impressive to me. i use my tape 400 times a day  on and off the clip. honestly best tape messure out their right now  and on a plus they've made some small improvments  easier to read lines  tapered to a podint for your inches  whitch helps  and its extra wide i can lay out in the air over 20 ft rooms if i really wanna.
146,great for iPhone cable  earbuds and plug.
966,This car charger adapter from Kssfire works great.<br />It fits perfectly into the car's cigarette lighter port. And the other end fits into the charger that I have for my headlight lamp flashlight.<br /><br />Charges quickly and completely  the LED light indicator let's you know that it's getting power --which is great for those of us with old cars  you know what I'm talking about... those out power outlets that are loose and lose connections all the time! Great price on this  works as advertised.<br /><br />I got a discount on this in exchange for my honest review.
629,I returned a pair of Roller Derby skates a bought a couple weeks ago and replaced them with these. I reviewed those also.  Save yourself money and hassle and buy these instead.<br /><br />These are amazingly great blades!  I feel like I should have paid more for them since they are so comfortable  smooth on the ground  and they don't have the crappy BOA lacing system that plagues many other K2 skates.  I guess time will tell how long these laces will hold up  but they are great so far.  The laces simply draw tight by pulling them up through the tongue.  They stay tight while skating.<br /><br />I was wanting to get a skate with 90+mm wheels (like my old K2s with the cruddy BOA lacing system) because the terrain I skate on is rocky and sandy.  I was pleasantly surprised and how when these glide over imperfect surfaces and resist rocks and debris.  I think that great shape of the skate and how well they fit your feet deserves the credit for the smooth operation.<br /><br />Ergonomically  these are far superior to the Roller Derby skates I returned and I think they are even better than my last 2 pairs of K2 skates simply because once the laces are tight  they are completely out of the way.  The toe box is well padded and a great shape for my average width feet.  The foot strap is effective and comfortable.  The ankle strap is also effective and comfortable.  When these are on your feet and laced up  you don't feel like you have a clunky contraction on your feet.  These feel like an extension of your foot.  You feel like a superhero with speed skate ability.<br /><br />I probably have 50-60 miles on them.<br /><br />Cheap at twice the price!
307,These are not 7 gallon bags. These bags are too thin. Do not waste your money.
977,Works great on my OpenBuilds C-Beam cutting aluminium  used the precise bits collet set from think n tinker. Planning to get another for my OX. Its a little thinner than the bosch so you'd have to shim it or make a new holder. Inventables has a design
632,This is a great laptop bag  perfect size and easy access to the laptop with opening the entire bag. I am not a fan of the shoulder strap pad included  but maybe it just need to be broken in as it's kind of bulky.
604,Very bad quality  clips was broken when it arrived. The plastic on top is very thin that u can squeeze it easily. The shipping took forever. Overall  wouldn't buy with this buyer
873,Great quality product. Well built. Does exactly what it is supposed to. Worth every penny.
553,Its ok  just flimsy and cheaply made. It will definitely dry your clothes and i do enjoy the fact that it will fold up so small for storage. Pulled it out to use for the third time and its ripping apart at the seams... returning itðŸ˜°ðŸ˜¢
816,geart product :) super comfy I don't know why people complain about it being too tight or not doing the job  unless they are aliens and have egg shaped heads it fits fine i wore it for 4-6 hours and didn't even notice it :)  and this is on top of the fact that I wear glasses and I have a larger than average head size  and for sound isolation its wonderful  obviously it doesn't block everything but pretty much everything and lowers the loud annoying noise to that of humming bird wings :) which is nice :) and in most cases I hear nothing or hardly anything at all  I tried them under several conditions  at home I don't hear anything from the street at all  the only thing I hear is my tinitus sadly  :(   outside what ever sounds there are are extremely muffled and very very low and I hear the vibration of my feet touching the ground louder than most other sounds  but that vibration is not a sound  its not hearing the foot steps like a sound traveling into your ear  its having the energy pass through your body kind of like hearing crunchy food  somehow that vibration travels through your body bones and makes it into the ear canal that way  and well if you can hear that over everything else  then the head phones are fantastic  tried them at school  works lovely  tested them with loud speakers and it works great  lowers the loud music very well and I added noise isolation ear plugs and together they are a dynamic duo :) of -60 DB    I heaven't used them for construction work like some reviewers claim and claim it is not satisfactory  how ever I did pass by a construction crew who were tearing up the pavement with jack hammers and hardly noticed it  in fact I kind of panicked  a bit because I wasn't sure how safe it was to come close to them since I could not hear them and I took off the headphones to compare and damn it was pretty loud without them  then on the train I saw a train worker with some massive bulky iso headphones that don't fold  and I was temped to let him know about these but he looked to be in a hurry  IN SUM  THEY'RE GREAT :) GET 2 JUST IN CASE
301,I have carpal tunnel syndrome. I've had the release surgeries done. Either way  giving anyone a massage is a very painful experience which left me feeling very guilty whenever my husband would complain of back pain and I couldn't do much to help.<br /><br />Then we found this little guy.<br />SUPER easy grip  slides great on clothes (no wasting lotion)  and best of all  no hand pain after giving a decent massage. Husband and I can finally take turns massaging EACH OTHER  not just him massaging me which is something he's learning to appreciate.<br />Great for sore backs  shoulders  necks and calves. Ergonomic and light weight.<br />Definitely recommend buying.
335,If you are sensitive to chemicals this may be your winner. No yeast issues using this product.
197,Awesome speaker! I take it everywhere. Charge really lasts. Sound is great. Range is fantastic. If you're in the market  get this one.
17,very good especially for notebooks with micro hdmi and you want to connect it to a computer screen
394,I have been using these vitamins for about a year now and I absolutely love them! However  there was one time when Amazon was out and I had to buy Women's One A Day. They were so aweful compared to these. These have a great natural berry flavor and a soft  easy to chew  texture.
73,So  I wouldn't have purchased this if it were not for my wife  who is infinitely frustrated with my audio setup.<br /><br />I needed something that would sit next to our TV  and be simple to use.  The fact that this has a remote is a nice bonus.  The fact that this can grab my local radio stations is a HUGE bonus - one which I didn't know it could do (does it via streaming).<br /><br />My problem is that I have this setup:<br /><br />Computer requests audio to be played from a Linux computer which uses a M2Tech Hiface to stream digital to my DAC (streamed lossless FLAC).  This then feeds into my preamp  and then amp and speakers.  To access the linux computer that runs the whole show  I have to have her use shell login to my linux host (not easy for most people  and if something goes wrong  she can't fix it).  You can then  from command line play pandora or music.<br /><br />So  those issues being stated  after plenty of research  I chose this.  I can connect this up right into my preamp  and she can use it pretty easily.  The setup was a snap  follow a few instructions  and I'm now linked up with my pandora account (I've got probably 40 stations I've been grooming for years).  Great.<br /><br />I had mistook the &#34;antenna&#34; in the product pictures for a coax hookup for an AM/FM antenna.  In fact this hookup is for the antenna to your wireless router.  Very fortunately  this nice box has the great feature of being able to pickup any radio station that streams their broadcasts (which as it turns out  is almost all of the local stations).  Not only that  but I can get stations that I would otherwise not be able to get at all (since I don't rely on an antenna  just whatever I choose to stream).  how do I get my local stations?  Simple !  you just set your location (enter your city I believe).  And it'll select the right stations for where you are.  It will also allow you to then progress outwards and grab more stations that you wouldn't otherwise be able to get with an antenna of probably any size.  I live in Baltimore  and it allows me to get stations hundreds of miles away!  Very slick!!<br /><br />The one downside to this product is that the built-in amplifier is really pretty poor quality.  However  I didn't buy this for that functionality anyway.  I only ended up using it  as my preamp crapped out  and I'm stuck using the built in amp for the time being.  It's nice that it's available  but don't think that if you have decent speakers  that you'll get very good sound quality.  You're much better off using the 'line out' and putting this into your favorite receiver or preamp  as the built in one just isn't so great  but it's functional.ith an antenna of probably any size.

198,Fine item.  Best reception I've had since DTV became a reality several years ago.  Picked up more channels that previous antennas.
806,GREAT SELLER PRODUCT WORKED GREAT
533,fan can run loud. But man... It's nice  does its job and was very easy to install.
947,This is a great flashlight!  Feels solidly built in the hand and the light output is really bright white. It comes in a polimer box (the box looks somewhat cheap but it is neat to have it for storage)  it comes with a charger but it can be used with AAA bateries. The price is also great  so  I bought another one!
133,You won't be disappointed. The only draw back is that you can't change out batteries
466,Perfect!
407,exactly what I wanted!
795,Good qualities and a great seller.
395,Excellent product<br />This is one if the few things I can use on my skin that doesn't cause a breakout and it leaves it so soft and refreshed
45,I LOVE THESE HEADPHONES! I am totally satisfied with the sound and the fact that they stay in my ears! They are great...and I love the color of course. :)
907,This knife was a gift to me.<br /><br />Great knife for the price.<br /><br />+++would recommend
372,Great product!
610,good to have
691,I have used this camping a few times now and it does a decent job of producing light for our tent.  I suggest reading all the specs as this is much smaller than I anticipated.  I bought one of the old version too and this is brighter (non-scientific based on trying to read using each to measure light).  You would not want to rely on this for camp site light.  For what you get and the price this is okay and I'm happy with my purchase 3.5 stars.
150,This product worked just as advertised.
370,Works great for tennis elbow. Only con is it's a bit large around for my small arm.Would be perfect if they had different size options.
19,Did not last long   Stop working within a year.
165,When I bought this speaker  I had one request.... I want to be able to wake up to the music of the Harry Potter Intro in mp3 with a soft wake up (volume gradually going up (which I emulated in audacity)).... Which I recommend to anyone with a relative light sleep  it really is magical.<br /><br />Anyway...the mp3 alarm is not reliable... worked fine for 3 days then doesn't start<br />I don't know if it's related to the way you previously stopped the music....unclear....<br />The screen is also way too bright (and quite small) to be used as a clock in a dark room (I put papers on top to soften it a little bit)<br /><br />I tried all buttons and buttons combinations to fix my alarm problem and nothing worked....<br />only unplug  turning off  turning back on fixed it....for one day....
577,We have a hard time keeping ice trays full at our lake house in the summer.  This is great. It's not silent when it's making a batch of ice but I couldn't call it loud either. The ice falling into the bin can be loud when you don't know it's going to happen.<br /><br />It's not high volume but we rarely ran out with a family of four in the summer putting ice in our drinks.
626,I really like the packaging of these microfiber towels. Each pouch (2) have a drawstring to close it. There's a small cloth for wiping sweat  and a larger towel to do yoga on. The larger mat is non- slip  and when wet it dries very quickly. I like to have wash these abs let them air dry. The pink is really pretty.  The material is kind-of thinner then I thought. But it still gets the job done. Also getting the towels back in the pouch wasnt easy . I had to refold them a few times to get it to fit. But overall I'm happy with this purchase. I received this product at a discounted price in exchange for my honest review.
656,Extremely bright lamp. Great for camping  power outages  looking at finite detail work  or other unlit situations. Recommended!
11,Love clock radio & CD player.  Easy to operate.
494,Really love this microwave. Has the one touch settings that I wanted along with the +30 seconds button.  Its a great size for a countertop.  It can be a little noisy when it beeps as others have said.
908,excellent weapon light for pistol with rail
711,IT WORKED PERFECTLY!
318,It did not do any good
256,The protein powder is tasty with no chalky aftertaste. Mix it with almond milk and the flavor is purely delightful.<br />The price is better than most vitamin and nutrition shops. Easy ship and quick to deliver for those without PRIME.<br />The berry flavor truly tastes like it is a bunch of berries mixing up the flow.<br />Try it out and decide for yourself.
773,the originals. (right? or was that croakies?) Anyway - these are really great  and fit my Oakley gascans well. they slip on the larger frames easily  and stay stuck on really well. The strap is really comfortable  and roomy enough to hang down out of the way when you slip your glasses off. they are seemingly very durable and well made  and I expect to have these for many years to come.
518,They worked great- however  there are absolutely no instructions and they are color coded  so we researched for 3 days to figure out which one went where.
353,Thanks!
869,Awesome tool!!!
651,It's ok.  The valve is a bit difficult to open but it does the job.
433,The rinse cycle leaves a lot to be desired. If you dont add too much soap works great though.
789,Bottle is great for every day use also they had great customer service skills with helping out with a cap issue but it was an amazing experience love the water vault they are great and I ordered 2 more bottles for future use or gift love them thank you......water vault
313,Bounce has always been a valuable item in my home. I use it in the dressers and in storage containers that house blankets and sheets.
238,I bought a second set for my friend.
886,not very flexible...get what u pay for
631,great product
247,Best wipes ever  have tried many brands but pampers hands-down are the best
291,Great product....delivered quickly
707,Delivery was fast and the shoe is great!
320,I love this scent. It is too bad that Bath and Body Works discontinued it but I am pleased that I found it through Amazon. If B&BW picks it back up  I can use their coupons and save a little money too!
228,I enjoy taking these much better than the big fish oil capsules
378,I'm not one to believe hype but I thought I'd give this product a try in preparation for the birth of my first child.<br /><br />Now I am currently 19 days postpartum  I delivered a 8lb baby boy via the help of a forcep delivery. I had several tears that were 2nd degree tears including a brutal episiotomy and severe hemorrhoids. My body was battered and bruised after 36hrs in labor and 4 hrs of pushing. I remember two days after coming home from the hospital and just crying in the shower because I had severe PTSD from L&D and also I was so wrecked in my most sensitive area that I was in constant pain.<br /><br />My care routine consisted of witch hazel diluted with water in my peribottle that I stole from the hospital (it really was my best friend after I would use the bathroom) but right next up the peribottle was this new mama bottom spray. After I would clean up with the peribottle I would spray this on and although I was so numb and swollen down there that I couldn't feel much of a cooling sensation. I loved the smell and the idea that it was helping me heal.<br /><br />More than two weeks postpartum I'm back in my feet and still using this spray which is in fact very cooling and very refreshing. I still have a long way to go in recovering down there  but this product has helped so far :)  I would gladly recommend it to any new moms out there recovering from child birth.
603,poor construction as mildew keeps forming in the top cover. Needs frequent cleaning with brush into hard to reach areas. I wouldn't buy this kind again.
68,My son gets 41 channels in Hickory NC. He is well pleased.
856,Good tool and seems good quality
178,Good quality Good Price!

261,Pen didn't write.  Had to get a new tip.  Luckily I found one on Amazon.
210,Delivered product was as expected.
794,Sorry  the product came without any sling and i had to return it
809,Excellent
43,Great product.
464,but it has not been installed yet!  Very nice looking stove top!
104,Wonderful wonderful product  don't think it could be improved I used for motorcycle trip long continuous wear 14hr days cross country in comfort no wind noise and better than a pair of custom made ear gear I had with for comparison.
833,While I did receive these gloves for free  I would not hesitate to pay full price for them. They are comfortable to use and truly functional. Most importantly the gloves keep me from slicing precious skin off my fingers. I highly recommend this product.
312,working good after one year using it.
898,Too much wind allowance into eyes  make mine water when riding my motorcycle.
804,Quality waterproofing and no issues at all.
945,This is the 3rd one I bought and all work good
569,worked perfect at my maytag
415,Looking forward to using this product.
282,Very good product   I can fell big deferent in training after 1 week of using it   the only problem with this product is that it too sweet.
304,This is a pretty decent lighter... I had some issues at first with getting it to light but after messing with it for like 20 seconds. No problems this may become my favorite single flame torch  and it is built like a tank!
630,Works well
364,I use this to diffuse essential oil to help with my allergies at night. It looks nice sitting on my bedside table. It does seem a little inconsistent with how long it lasts  which might just have to do with the humidity in my room. Sometimes I can get more than two nights out of a single filling. Other times it's just one night. But it's always been at least one night.<br /><br />I'm sure it varies depending on the quality of oils you use  so I don't want to knock this product since I'm not certain if it's the reason  but I did notice that the scent of the oil is only noticeable for the first few hours. The steam does last all night though so that's good! It's not much steam though  so if you're hoping to use this also as a humidifier I don't think it would work very well.<br /><br />I have two main complaints with this. The first is removing the lid to refill it. I have pretty severe repetitive motion injuries and some nights after a hard day at work I can't quite grip it well enough to open it. It's a pretty wide smooth surface you have to grip to twist it open. And it's not the easiest to put back on either. So if anyone has an injury or illness that makes it difficult to open jars or anything then this will probably give you some issues as well. The second issue I have is the lights under the buttons are crazy bright! I like sleeping in dark  as dark as possible. I put electrical tape over the buttons which helped. But the light still reflects a little bit up through the white top. It's not unbearable  but I'd prefer if there was some way to keep it from lighting up at all. Take note  I'm not talking about the light feature because that can be turned off. I'm talking about the light built into the buttons to signal different things (like whether it's on or not) that can't be turned off.
164,Love it
135,As described. Just what I wanted
765,The helmet fit my average sized adult female head perfectly. It adjusts larger and smaller. I think it would probably fit my 10-year-old without difficulty as well. It's comfortable and vents well. Hopefully it will keep my head safe in an accident.
436,Arrived quickly and was easy to install
868,Perfect for my Bugout Bag.  I love it.
7,works great
427,The dryer for this stackable unit destroys clothes.  A loose button is found almost every time buttoned up shirts go in the dryer.  The vent holes to the lint trap are very large  and just the right size for buttons to be lodge in to be ripped off.  I have had buttons destroyed and holes ripped open when the buttons get ripped off.  All they need to do is design a replacement piece and I will get to keep my buttons.
512,Shipped incredibly fast  easy set up  and what you see in the pictures is what you get! There was a small ding on the top of the cooler but it's hardly anything to complain about. The dual zone cooling seems to work well and despite some other reviews  my Pinot Noir bottles are able to fit without any hassle. Worst case  just take out a shelf if you have a larger bottle that won't fit.<br /><br />Really my only concern is that there is no space for a standing bottle but overall it is a sleek  affordable  compact cooler that works exactly as advertised.
338,I did not realize when I bought this that the amount of product in it is actually quite small and you can see from the color of the capsule that it is primarily rice flour.
211,So far I've felt no change in my appetite and if anything I feel heavier  I feel bloated. I'm 5'4 and 118. Notttt going to be considering any product like this one again.
704,great
695,my grandson loves this scooter the best birthday ever!
406,Works awesome for apt size 110 dryer. Handles load from apt size washer just fine. It does take longer to dry. Electric cost savings over a full size 220 is worth the time. Does not add much humidity unless lint filter is full.
25,Great little device if you need to convert micro and mini HDMI to full hdmi and down want to buy new cables.<br />So far mine has been working great.<br />Its small in size so its easy to carry with your computer or tablet.<br />It carries audio like all HDMI cables.
46,Cheap and good
268,Remember Matthew 7:21
700,They work great on my bike  and look good also.They feel sturdy enough and my only problem was that one of them got a little bend during shipping and now I'll try to make it work with my bottle . Other that that......5 stars
507,We purchased this last December and had it installed in February for our kitchen remodel. I was getting frustrated with trying to keep it clean.it was beginning to look like a 10 year old stove. Then  I used Bar Keepers Friend on it and it now looks brand new! Burners are good  some pans slide on the grate  but you get used to it. If you are looking for down draft gas stove top  this one fills the bill.
795,Good qualities and a great seller.
93,I ordered one  Loved it.  So I  gave the first one to my husband who was traveling for a month and ordered another for myself......wouldn't turn on after charging.  Returned for another one...same problem.  GRRRRRR!
85,Nice sound for what it is â€“ a small Bluetooth speaker.  Syncs easily with my iPad.  Good clear sound  decent bass.  Sounds great on talk radio stations.  Nice little unit for the price.
590,Don't understand why  but it is leaking water inside. Wish it was a little bit bigger and colder.  Good for soda only.
122,Good sound... stays in place when running
728,The mask is excellent.  It did fog up initially but after rinsing it in shampoo  it went away.  I liked the semi dry snorkel and worked a lot better than the cheap rental ones.
386,Good Stuff! I did a trial run with this vitapak and then other supplements (that were a bit cheaper in cost). After trials I could tell the difference b/t Raw Re-Loaded and other supplements (i.e. Animal Paks). I got back on Re-Loaded about three months ago and I don't plan on stopping. I'm stronger and bigger! I can tell the positive difference without a shadow of a doubt.
586,OMG my Clothes are finally getting Washed like the Good Old Days !<br />I waited for over 2 months to get this Speed Queen n it has been Worth the Wait. The  clothes are all washed in a More<br />gentle way n come out of the washer less Wrinkled - once in the dryer they are in better shape -Less wrinkles n<br />Here's a Novelty CLEANED . I threw Out into the Garbage the 4 year Old Computerized Washer with the New Govm't<br />Regulated water rationing Washing Machines .<br />This is a KEEPER !
585,Been nearly a year since we got this and we still love it.  Keeps everything the perfect temp.<br />Bottom row works great for larger bottles.<br />Wish it had a place you could store one sitting up if you don't finish and need to reseal<br />Can't beat the price.
938,Well not work with my torch
158,I like this device.  The sound is clear and it carries well.  It is so convenient to carry only this speaker.  I can use it through wi-fi or I can plug it in to my laptop and play my playlist.  It has a rechargeable battery and lets you know when the battery is low so you can plug it in and charge it. I am pleased with this purchase.
277,Doesn't work at all! It's brand new and it won't start. I've changed the batteries  followed the instructions  and it just won't start at all...ever.
591,I really was not sure about this thing when we bought it. I have to say I'm very impressed.  It is a little small but if what you need washed fits in it  it does a really good job.
439,Very nice microwave  great price
849,Seems fine
783,Only got one piece so the description is false.
746,Great snorkeling gear very well made and fits all sizes!
268,Remember Matthew 7:21
765,The helmet fit my average sized adult female head perfectly. It adjusts larger and smaller. I think it would probably fit my 10-year-old without difficulty as well. It's comfortable and vents well. Hopefully it will keep my head safe in an accident.
764,Very sturdy pump.
207,It still is itching like always. maybe a little less but it didn't fix any long term problem. Just sooth a little bit.
940,Klein Great tool!!
285,great love it thanks---pt
298,I was very skeptical about buying dryer balls but a friend advised me that the dryer balls reduce drying time and there's no need to buy dryer sheets and it takes away static I couldn't believe it does so many things so I ended up buying them. I highly recommend these dryer balls because my gas bill from my dryer has gone down significantly
