890,This is a great light!  It's very compact and fits in a shirt pocket. USB charging is quick and easy and there's no need for a special charger...use the same on you use for most of your devices!  This is also the brightest light I've ever owned  one of my colleagues now has flashlight envy.  His &#34;S-light&#34; isn't nearly as bright and it's twice the size and price.  Definitely a must have!,Product Quality

622,This is my second time buying this system from RAD Cycle. It works very well  the price is reasonable  and opens up my garage floor. The only thing to be aware of is that the installation is not very hard  but will most likely require attaching it to a board  before it's attached to the ceiling. There is another option out there that comes with it's own board integrated in  which would make the installation just a little faster.,Usability

538,We bought this microwave 2 years ago as part of a home remodel. It was great while it worked but recently stopped working. Sharp warranty is only 1 year. For the amount of money we spent on this I would expect it to last more than 2 years.,Product Quality
66,Has great features like iPod dock and USB port  but the sound is so unclear.<br />I am very disappointed,Product Quality
562,They work fine  now its just a matter to see how long they truly last.<br />It's difficult to place the adapter onto the top that is required for my GE refrigerator  but this has been true with any of this class of filters  even the original equipment filters.,Product Quality
512,Shipped incredibly fast  easy set up  and what you see in the pictures is what you get! There was a small ding on the top of the cooler but it's hardly anything to complain about. The dual zone cooling seems to work well and despite some other reviews  my Pinot Noir bottles are able to fit without any hassle. Worst case  just take out a shelf if you have a larger bottle that won't fit.<br /><br />Really my only concern is that there is no space for a standing bottle but overall it is a sleek  affordable  compact cooler that works exactly as advertised.,Shipping

470,I will never hesitate to purchase the square trade protection plans.  Our Sharp AQUOS 70&#34; TV died at 13months.  Square Trade had a list of options for replacing the TV to us in 24 hours and a new TV here in our home within a week of contacting them.  This is a service organization that understands and appreciates what it means to service their customers.,Customer Service
727,O.K. bag just came in delivered a day earlier than stated. Thank yah Amazon. Damn I live in a Nat. Forest swamp and have to travel a 100 miles round trip to git too a store. No mo  Amazon delivers to my door at better prices. Discovered Amazon later in life  sadly. LOL.<br /> The bag? Very well made solid construction. Lots of compartments  pistol compartment rugs tossed in  room for everything yah need at the range.<br /> Old bags going out  I love this one.,Shipping

938,Well not work with my torch,Product Quality
180,Fairly sturdy  all metal construction  it did come with wall anchors  screws & straps to secure it upright if you need to do so. No missing parts  and the fit & finish are very good. Instructions are very basic  but it's easy tool free assembly means a 1 sheet instruction page is fine.<br /><br />As the shelves are adjustable to wherever you want them to go  you may have extra shelves leftover depending on how and where you place them on the poles.  As I migrate my DVD collection to Blu-Ray  I'll shrink the space between shelves and add the extras later.<br /><br />Overall  very pleased with this product at this price point.,Product Quality

242,I never thought that I would be the one to buy a Fitbit. I wanted to be the one young person who didn't have a wearable piece of technology  but when I found a Fitbit Charge HR for half price at an REI Garage Sale I couldn't pass it up.  For someone who is an avid cyclist and exercise junky I have used this little watch more than expected.  It has been such a useful tool for my health and workouts and I cannot seem to live without it now! It tracks my sleep and shows me when I have been awake/restless throughout the night and gives me goals for a good nights sleep. I like that it counts all of my steps during my day  including my rides  which has been super helpful.  The only issues I have found with my Fitbit so far is minor troubles with syncing it to my computer and phone. I just have to reset the Fitbit and it syncs right back into the system! The best part about the reset function is that it only restarts the Fitbit itself and NOT your data! :),Aesthetic Appeal

152,I bought one of these radios from BiMart about 4 years ago without listening to it (the selection was very limited and I was in a big rush). I would not buy it again. The sound is tinny  it has no automatic shutoff (a must for me)  and the station tuning knob makes a huge change with only the slightest turn of the knob; that shortcoming drives me nuts. I use it only on camping and hunting trips to receive the Weather Service weather reports and as a backup for my Sangean AM/FM portable radio (love that one). I never could get it to work with the hand crank; maybe I am not doing something right. I have several other Midland products (CB  FRS  GMRS radios) and they are all pretty good but Midland fumbled the ball with this one.,Product Quality

159,I have ordered 3 packages of these over the past few weeks and all of them have been different sizes. The first 100 fit perfectly with about 1/4&#34; overhang at the top  I like that compared to the other sleeves that usually hang 1/2&#34;-3/4&#34; over the top of the record. The second 100 I received were cut incorrectly and I couldn't even get the record inside of them. I sent those back and re-ordered  when the 3rd shipment arrived they fit perfectly but some of them are cut too short and don't even reach the top of the record.<br /><br />This would be a great product if the company had better quality control standards  as is I won't be using these in the future.,Product Quality
365,Good product but a little difficult to fill.,Product Quality
618,This is the best item I  have purchased for camping. I was recently camping for 2 weeks and this shower was perfect. It allowed me to take a hot shower everyday. I charged it once or twice when I used my car. When charged the pump work well. It never died on me. Some people said it didn't hold a charge. WRONG!!! When I got home a put it in a pot of water to discharge it and it ran for almost 20 minutes.<br />When camping  I never took a 20 minute shower but several 5-6 minute showers almost daily. I definitely recommend this item for all campers.,Product Quality
145,I bought this as a replacement for my Verizon FIOS backup battery. The original battery lasted over three years... this one lasted 8 months. The &#34;Designed for long life: 6 - 8 years&#34; statement is a joke.<br /><br />I finally contacted the company after a week of trying (even after a year  their website listed on the battery is not working) and they offered me a replacement  however I had to ship the battery back to them first at my expense. To pay $20 to return a $23 battery for replacement is ridiculous  so their &#34;3-year replacement warranty&#34; is absolutely worthless.,Price
543,Nice washer. Unfortunately  it leaked all over the floor with the first wash. I think the corrugated drainage tubing got damaged or was defective.,Product Quality
970,excellent,Product Quality
485,So disappointing. Like another reviewer said  you constantly have to tear this thing apart when it stops draining  to unclog the filter. Now sure how quarterS and socks and undies manage to even get in there  but it's a huge pain in the ass!! 3rd time in 2 1/2 years that I had to unclog it only to realize the pump burned out! Oh and the door has had a leak since day one but of course  the repair men say whatever they can to avoid actually fixing it. Needless to say  after 3 visits from them  washer is still broken and out of warranty. GARBAGE!,Product Quality
738,This set is a wonderful tool addition to my tool kit. I use this set every day sense I got. Just always good for on the go repairs. I used to use my leatherman multi tool for everything but now I find myself using this set more. Highly recommend this jewelers screw driver set.,Usability

389,This has to be the finest wheat grass around! The package is awesome and definitely love that I can rezip the bag. What is even better is it just needs to be in a cool dry place after opening. ya know how sometimes you have to put it in the freezer? Well this I didnt find anywhere it said it could and I also like that it doesn't expire with in the month of opening which helps me. NOw I do want to let you know  wheat grass has a very strong taste. I love to put it in my smoothies because the smoothie helps mask the taste.  I put it in my omelet once  thats a no go. ABORT MISSION!<br />I overall loved this. I also make smoothies for my daughters so this is a great way for me to incorporate veggies into her life. I do forewarn you that veggies can make you go to the bathroom so beware when you do first sart using this product that you may have poop just a l little extra.,Usability

884,This is my third purchase of this base.  Their customer service is excellent.  I had a mis-threaded axle bolt and nut and one phone call got it in the mail to me. This was the first material issue I have had with them.<br /><br />The bases themselves are rigid and easily adjustable. However you do have to really think about how to affix your tool to the base.  Figuring out how to attach the tool to a 3/4 inch plywood sheet is easy but then attaching the sheet tightly to the base takes some thought.  Each tool required a different configuration because no two had the same bolt down arrangement. The provided hole in the corners does not lend itself well to many of my tools  but oversizing the base addressed the issue.,Customer Service

359,Excellent product. Combined with the curve pills it will do wonders. But you have to be consistent and a few workouts a week should do it. The cream smells great. And absorbs pretty quickly so you are not waiting around to dry. A little goes a long way. The pills never made me feel funny or any different. Must be stored in a cool place. Great product well continue using. 👏,Usability

332,Great carrier oil. I use it alone to massage my scalp and my boyfriend scalp. I use it on days where my scalp feels too dry/stripped. My boyfriend had horrendous dry scalp (snowflakes all over his shirt and in his hair :/). I massaged this and occasionally tea tree oil in his hair every night for a few days  and it really cleared his flakes up! The tea tree oil helped  but this alone would be fine. I read it jojoba oil/wax is one of the closest substrates to human sebum (which our skin and scalp produce that make it oily). Seems to work that way. His scalp is realllllly dry and his hair is so thick it just kinda lays there (he can go like...5 days without washing his hair). So I apply very liberally throughout his whole scalp. Seems to do the trick! He loves how it makes his hair more manageable and actually &#34;do something&#34; (his words).<br /><br />Really great moisturizer too. I think it'll come in handy in the cold  windy winters here where it is hard to retain moisture. I think it would feel wonderful warmed up and massaged into the scalp or body :).,Usability
758,Complete made in china crap!  The first pole seam ripped out before I even got the 2nd of 3 poles in.  And the &#34;tarp&#34;  if you can call it that  is about as durable as a disposable rain poncho. Worst &#34;quality&#34; ever!  Even if you could get it together it would rip in the sun after less than a weeks use I am sure...... And the material is made of something that leaves little sharp things in your hands like fiberglass when you fold it back up.  Oh and the zipper on the bag ripped out when I tried to stuff it back in for the return.<br /><br />The only thing I liked was that Amazon is giving me a complete refund with free return shipping :),Product Quality

705,It's a excellent bottle. At the first uses (5 at least) the water tastes horrible (I think due to the long time of storage and/or the excess of filter products). However  after these uses the water tastes good and you forget that you are using a filter. I recommend!,Product Quality

589,Never buy Frigidaire - I bought the Fridge  Microwave and Oven.<br /><br />Two months old the oven light died.<br /><br />2 years the microwave door handle just broke off - now I must tell you that I very rarely use a microwave. Just to boil water for coffee. Can't be fixed.<br />after a couple months the plastic glass had gotten wierd and like blotchy looking.<br /><br />Fridge- I used to buy purified ice and put it into the freezer. A year after getting the fridge I had a RO system installed and had the technician set up RO water to the ice maker about 3 months later the ice maker died. No kidding. I would never encourage anyone to buy this brand. It was good money thrown away.,Product Quality

665,This item is awesome. It holds temp very well if you plan on traveling with it for a long period of time.<br /><br />Overall;<br />Design is awesome.<br />Handle is tight around the body (if you have big hands/knuckles touch/rub body while holding) Not a problem though.<br />Keeps temperature very very good.<br />Quick rinse and easy to put a sink brush to do minor scrubbing.<br />Wide spout for easy fill/pour<br />Able to unlock lid and pour with one hand. (May takes a couple attempts to get this technique down)<br />Lid locks very good/tight<br />Durable build<br />Government label is on the bottom. (See local growler fill rules/state laws)<br />NO COMPLAINTS ABOUT THIS GROWLER!!!<br /><br />Quick test Note: May not be 100% accurate but just to give anyone reading an idea.<br />I poured (5) 12oz beers and left growler out for a few hours at room temp not exposed to direct sunlight while I drank from it. Drink stayed as cold as when I first poured. I did leave some of the left over beer overnight to see how it held up in the growler and the only downside was that next morning I noticed the beer did start to go flat. I understand this would happen and I just wanted to see how it would hold up. Noting surprising but I personally would recommend no longer then 24 hours in a pinch but most probably drink five beers in that time anyways. After that beer starts to go flat. Recommended average time for a growler is max 36 hours.<br />This growler is highly recommend as it is easy to hold when filled  easy to pour  not designed to drink directly from the spout but you can.,Product Quality
932,This knife is spectacular. I got it for my boyfriend and he is over the moon happy with it. (no seriously  he is. Sometimes I catch him just hold it and looking at it adoringly.)

670,Great back support and sturdy. I've used many back supports over the past 20 years this one is very excellent. It fills well and deflates well and it rolls up to a small size  all excellent features. I would have given this product 5 stars but I would prefer a choice of colors and I also don't like the shape that much. It's a dogbone shape and I would prefer  the opposite with more support in the center of the back and a little less width. I have bought three of these in the past year because I like them so much. Also  the McKenzie back support (also very good) has similar limitations in color choice and shape. IF I could give this 4.5 stars I would but just holding back a little for color and shape.,Product Quality

373,Best general sports tape you can buy.  I have used several other brands but always come back to thie Johnson & Johnson Coach tape because of it's durability and ease of use.
