300,I have taken probiotics for years changing from one to another.  I bought these because they were cheaper that what I'd been taking and they<br />seem to do as well as any others I have taken.  Probiotics have helped me so much  I have chronic inflammation and infections of the colon<br />and small intestine and try not to miss a day taking them.,Product Quality
738,This set is a wonderful tool addition to my tool kit. I use this set every day sense I got. Just always good for on the go repairs. I used to use my leatherman multi tool for everything but now I find myself using this set more. Highly recommend this jewelers screw driver set.,Usability

273,This  product I have used for the past 2 years when a neighbor suggested it for a 27 year old problem I had with RLS.  I hadn't slept but 1 - 2 hours a night at least 5 nights a week and then would sleep heavily  and restlessly for 2 nights.  It sure wore me  down.  When I began using this at only a teaspoon per day in water (it is pleasant) it only  took about a week or so and I have been sleeping ever since - every night.  So very thankful for that neighbor's suggestion.  I am passing on the word to others  who cannot sleep.,Usability
932,This knife is spectacular. I got it for my boyfriend and he is over the moon happy with it. (no seriously  he is. Sometimes I catch him just hold it and looking at it adoringly.) It is crazy sharp and the case is very high quality. In fact  everything about this knife is high quality. If you are looking for a good knife  look no further. I don't think you will find a better one than this Case knife.,Product Quality

447,Nice unit  however  only works with what I would say is standard slim wine bottles. Any bottle that is odd size will not fit on the racks.  So  to use the fridge for varying size wine bottles you would have to remove some shelves to allow them to fit which reduces the capacity.  I'm sending mine back  which has not been a problem so far working with Amazon.,Customer Service

186,Product is just okay! Volume level is not very good  I am used to going louder. Charge only lasts for maybe 2.5 hours of continuous use. This is my first pair of bluetooth earbuds. I feel gullible because I was going to purchase a pair for around 20$ and I thought the price point was too low so instead I purchased these. I think maybe for a tryout pair I could have gone with the 20$ pair.,Product Quality

676,Purchased this bike for my two year old son  who at the time of receiving the bike was approximately 32 inches tall.  The bike fit him perfectly with the seat post most of the way down  giving lots of room for growth.  We gave him this bike in March and I am not writing this review in August  so this review is with 5-6 months of experience with using the bike.<br /><br />The bike arrived in a relatively small box and assembly was done in 5-10 minutes.  Attached the handlebars and seat post  tighten with a provided allen wrench and done.  The bike is made of solid metal (steel maybe?)  is very sturdy but not too heavy for even my toddler.  He is able to pick it up and maneuver it himself.  We have left the bike outside accidentally and the paint and bike is still like new.  A very sturdy bike  a great design and the concept of a balance bike was perfect for my son.  Once he warmed up to the idea of being on the bike  he walked while standing for the first month or so  has since learned to sit and walk and now if quickly catching onto the idea that he can control how fast he goes!!  Last month I raised the seat for the first time and he still has plenty of room to grow with this bike.  We will use this bike until he is ready to transition into a bike with pedals and no training wheels.  He'll be ready thanks to Strider!,Usability

626,I really like the packaging of these microfiber towels. Each pouch (2) have a drawstring to close it. There's a small cloth for wiping sweat  and a larger towel to do yoga on. The larger mat is non- slip  and when wet it dries very quickly. I like to have wash these abs let them air dry. The pink is really pretty.  The material is kind-of thinner then I thought. But it still gets the job done. Also getting the towels back in the pouch wasnt easy . I had to refold them a few times to get it to fit. But overall I'm happy with this purchase. I received this product at a discounted price in exchange for my honest review.,Product Quality

267,my dentures fit perfectly  and I like the strainer cup so my fingers do not have to touch the cleaning solution. I just wish it did not leak. I travel a lot and am getting used to my new dentures so there are times I take my cup in the car with me filled with water ( my dentist told me to soak them in water when they are not in my mouth). So if anyone has a suggestion for a cup that does not leak it will be appreciated,Usability

455,I bought this to repair our KitchenAid blender  model KSB5WH4. I could have purchased the part from several suppliers ranging in price from $4.86 to $9 and most charged a little more for shipping. This part from Amazon does seem to be the same factory certified part as described and the package says &#34;made in US&#34; which is nice. Very easy replacement.<br /><br />The coupler on our blender broke apart  that is  the hard  black rubber part broke apart and so only the metal core/insert remained on the blender. I read a few online instructions on replacement and then watched a few youtube videos showing the replacement. Instructions are included with this part and includes a few photos. removal of the old coupler is even easier than the youtube videos show.<br /><br />The coupler core appears to be made of aluminum and is screwed onto a hardened steel shaft. The instructions require you to insert a flat screw driver under the old coupler and just pry it up a few times  rotating your position until it comes off. Because the coupler core is aluminum  it's really just prying the threads up which give way to the harder steel. Once off  you remove any bits of aluminum threads that came off. Then simply screw the new coupler onto the threaded shaft. You can and just need to hand tighten it  counter clockwise. The normal blending motion/direction tightens the coupler further. It literally took me all of 90 seconds to complete the whole replacement.,Usability

753,It is not a overly well built flashlight. Its draw for me was that it is LED  cheap and large enough to put super capacitors  and a charging port. Plus I have a 6V battery to use for something else!  Not thrilled with the quality of the off/on switch.  So far it has worked if wiggled but I may have to change it out if I depend on this flashlight.<br /><br />http://www.instructables.com/id/The-EXTREMELY-EASY-VERSION-of-the-Super-Capacitor-/step2/The-Circuit/,Price

879,This is a truly excellent router.  I bought it used through Amazon.  I'm knocking it one star because the Amazon shipper did an awful job of packing this item.  Systainer handle was detached  T Lock detached   systainer lay out picture shredded  internal  moulded foam padding broken. (This may sound picky  but working systainer boxes make organizing and transporting tools much easier.)  The router however is top notch.  Dust collection is superior to all other routers I have (and I have many).  Handling is also excellent   this machine is heavy but its weight seems to improve control.  Very powerful  just as a test I installed a 3.25&#34; raised panel profile bit  no problem with control and produced an smooth edge.  Also the plunge lock feature allows for fast precision adjustments to depth.  If you use a router often and can handle the cost  this one's a good choice.  The accessory kit is also costly but almost a necessity.,Shipping
741,Kids are having a blast.  It does feel a bit on the heavier side after wearing shoes though.  The braking is not quite what I expected.  Kids took a very long time to figure out how to stop (even after reading instructions  it doesn't quite work as they wrote)<br /><br />I would have preferred no color / neutral colors for the lower price.  The pink color feels like terribly awkward even for my girls.,Usability

473,I love this machine! and the matching dryer too!<br /><br />Ok to set the record straight. About 4 years ago I fell for the &#34;all about being green front loader&#34;.  I bought an LG Front loader...It has been one of the most miserable 4 years of doing laundry imaginable. I would have never expected such an absolute nightmare. My laundry room has been stacked sky high with clothes that stink so bad that I would have to re-wash them four or five times until they were even wearable. I tried everything  I called the manufacture and begged for guidance! After multiple washings  I would resort to filling the bathtub and soaking all of the dark clothes. I even turned to using bleach - which I haven't used in decades. I couldn't take it anymore. I bought the Speed Queen AYN412 and the matching Dryer. I couldn't be happier with my new SPEED QUEEN I LOVE IT!. I would highly recommend this product.<br /><br />I received my new Speed Queen Washer and Dryer four days ago. It is fantastic! Yes... It looks and acts old-school. (It is true that my neighbor did kind of snicker when she saw it and even more when I told her how happy I was about my new Washer and Dryer) But I love this washer and dryer set. The clothes come out clean smelling and the towels are so fluffy! They look and feel like they have been actually washed. I know right? Imagine that! The clothes come out of the dryer warm and mostly wrinkle free. I can put in as many clothes in this machine as my old LG Front loader with no problem.  I have washed 16 loads of wash in 4 days. I have washed everything from white towels to washable delicate silk and even pantyhose.... Every load - Perfect every time! AND you might want to sit down for this... It takes 50 minutes to wash AND dry a load of laundry. Yep this working mom is very happy about that.  GOODBYE crappy - beat the heck out of the my clothes LG Front loader... Goodbye Forever - we are never never ever getting back together..... P.S. ... As far as the water savings... are you kidding? one load being washed five times only to be sent to a full bathtub doesn't look like any kind of savings to me.vings... are you kidding? one load being washed five times only to be sent to a full bathtub doesn't look like any kind of savings to me.,Usability

It even towel-dries my long hair  which is something no other towel can do. My only issue was that the snap for the hanging loop came apart and fell off the towel after only one day. This loop should be sewn on to prevent this from happening. That being said  I love this towel anyway and would totally buy again.,Product Quality

861,Excellent product unless you exceed the operating temperatures  which are ridiculously low. I tried to run this in Tucson during the summer months in 105F. The housing  being black  soaked up the sun and heated up to at least 135-140F  which rendered the laser completely inoperative (zero light emitted). Do not use this accessory for high-temperature environments as it just won't work!<br /><br />*UPDATE TO 1 STAR (NOV15)* In cold weather  this light continues to fail. The lights intermittently turn off during shooting sessions. I would not recommend this light for tactical/life and death situations.,Usability

I listen to music mostly on my iPad and have a subscription to Tidal premium musi service right now. The clarity of the music is amazing.

174,after a lightening strike wiped out my old receiver along with my music streaming devices (Grace and Roku) I was looking for an all in one 2 channel receiver that would stream internet radio  play Pandora type services and stream from my 400GB music database.  After researching on line  I bought this unit.<br /><br />It arrived today.  Set up was easy. It took longer un untangle the rats nest of old wires than to set up the new unit.  I connected my wired network and started to play around.  The sound quality is excellent!  The choices of inputs are excellent as well.  The one great shortcoming is the display panel.  I cannot understand why Yamaha would put 1980's technology into this otherwise modern  high quality system.  It has a one line 13 character dot matrix display for alpha numeric messages  such as track name  station id etc.  beyond me why they cut this corner.<br /><br />What saves the day is the app.  Yamaha NP Controller allows you to pretty much do everything from your android or iOS device.  The app is smooth  fast and intuitive.  Ps: do not download the Yamaha AV Controller App as it does not apply to this unit.,Product Quality

241,At 55  I've used all the different razors out there. Three  four and five blades  electric  electric you can use in the shower with a &#34;goo&#34; dispenser  and disposable. Even some disposables from other countries. I decided to try the old school safety razor  and I gotta tell you  its pretty darn good. Requires a little more caution  with nice  sharp &#34;Feather&#34;-brand blades  but its a great shave. This Weishi fits nice in my hand  good balance  and just the right weight. Cleaning is so much better than with the multi-blades. Nothing gets stuck between blades  and you can open it up and really wash out the inside. I guess that sometimes old is new  and tried and true is better than newfangled. I'll probably keep the Harry's for traveling  but this is the new standard in my bathroom.,Product Quality

835,Just be careful when buying them as some vendors advertise box of 12 but only ship one  Ask first before ordering.<br /><br />Remember one thing about less than 180 degree vision: anything you see wearing safety or any other glass's is that anything you see is either a threat or an opportunity  Other products that block side vision are for my world 'dangerous' .<br /><br />180 degree vision is important.  Looking cool is not why I buy them  Any time I am out mowing changing the shape of something these are what I wear to protect my eyes from the bright sun light.<br /><br />Unfortunately I learned too late how important that protection is.<br />Never go outside without them is the new rule.<br />These are so light  you know they are there but hardly feel them<br /><br />These allow almost no unfiltered light  getting to your eyes.,Usability

627,When I first bought these I was worried about the 1 star rating a saying that the pedals started creaking when relatively new. I bought them anyway and am glad that I did. After about 100 of road use one of the pedals did start to creak. All I had to do to fix it we take the axles out and make sure that the bearings were adjusted properly and repacked them with grease. I love these pedals. The only reason I didn't give them 5 stars was that I had to fiddle with them when they were basically new.,Product Quality

759,worked great  love not having to carry fuel canisters. Tested it at home  boiled a cup of water in under 4min. It did take considerably longer to boil water while backpacking (5500'+ elevation) mostly the problem was the breeze though since in the morning (no breeze)it heated up water quite quickly. My 24oz stanley cup barely fit with the pot holder flipped in so I've made a small bracket to hold it. I've also made a windshield from a lightweight aluminum baking sheet so we'll see if that helps.

315,OMG! The best lube out on the market! I bought this after reading reviews on other sites. I thought what the heck  if so many people are raving  we should give it a try. My man was a bit reluctant because ALL of the other flavored lube in our drawer tasted like metal and leave a funky after taste and feel sticky (total turn-off OUCH). After trying the Wicked brand - WE'RE SOLD! Not only is it tasty and non sticky  it wipes off easily  no artificial ingredients  and it lasts a long time. The bottle is sleek and discreet  and completely changed our view on flavored lube. It's so good that he threw our other lubes away. Do yourself a flavor (hee hee) and try the pom favor. It's so good I'm tempted to try it over ice cream!,Product Quality

(May takes a couple attempts to get this technique down)<br />Lid locks very good/tight<br />Durable build<br />Government label is on the bottom. (See local growler fill rules/state laws)<br />NO COMPLAINTS ABOUT THIS GROWLER!!!<br /><br />Quick test Note: May not be 100% accurate but just to give anyone reading an idea.<br />I poured (5) 12oz beers and left growler out for a few hours at room temp not exposed to direct sunlight while I drank from it. Drink stayed as cold as when I first poured. I did leave some of the left over beer overnight to see how it held up in the growler and the only downside was that next morning I noticed the beer did start to go flat. I understand this would happen and I just wanted to see how it would hold up. Noting surprising but I personally would recommend no longer then 24 hours in a pinch but most probably drink five beers in that time anyways. After that beer starts to go flat. Recommended average time for a growler is max 36 hours.<br />This growler is highly recommend as it is easy to hold when filled  easy to pour  not designed to drink directly from the spout but you can.,Product Quality

570,FIRE HAZARD - AVOID!!!!!<br />The knobs created two fires in our house already  in the two months we have used the stove.<br />Anyone walking by can accidentally brush against the knob with barely any pressure and accidentally turn on the stove.<br />Once a shoebox sitting on the stove caught on fire  the second time it was a wooden cutting board.<br />This stove should be recalled.  When I complained to our local Samsung appliance technician  he told me that Samsung has had 100's or 1 000's of complaints about this  but that Samsung is actually waiting for people to die before they care to do anything about this.<br />When I called Samsung's corporate &#34;Executive Relations&#34; office I spent over half an hour on hold  then an hour with a true idiot who provided zero assistance.  Their customer service is useless.<br />I WILL NEVER BUY ANOTHER SAMSUNG PRODUCT AGAIN.,Product Quality

495,Same as everyone else  NEVER buy Samsung major kitchen appliances. I spent over $5K a little over 5 yrs ago. Dishwasher died in 18m and had to be fully replaced  Bosch working great since the. Refrigerator ice maker died at 2yrs  replaced and 2nd one just died at 3yrs old last month. Now SMH9187 microwave  that worked okay at least for 5 yrs in very light use  just died with broken door latch (like dozens of others hit). Fixed it per YouTube video by drilling new hole in plastic door latch and moving spring. That worked fine but in middle of night 2 days before that  microwave beeped in middle of the night on its own  then had E-13 on the display.   Reset it and now getting either the dreaded SE error or worse  it literally in under 5 minutes suddenly turns on by ITSELF showing something about cooking a potato! Now after seeing hundreds of similar complaints including that microwave caused at least a couple fires I'm now scared to leave it plugged in when not home  especially since I have 3 pets. Going to replace with nice GE new one. Last GE microwave lasted over 12yrs!  Also had 2 Samsung LCD TV's  1 BluRay and 1 DVD player all die in under 2yrs too.  NEVER  EVER GOING TO BUY ANYTHING FROM SAMSUNG AGAIN!!!  Shame on them for fooling me more than once but beyond shame on them for their utter lack of safety and concern for their customers!,Product Quality

356,I have pretty severe Sjogren's Syndrome (dry eyes  nose  and mouth)  and I have tried EVERYTHING.... It also doesn't help that I live in MI where the winter climates are cold & extremely dry. Every other product I have so far tried  either doesn't work at all or if it works  it only helps for about 5-10 minutes and then I have to re-apply. This product isn't a miracle  but out of everything I've tried  it seems to work the best. I especially have trouble wearing my contacts because my eyes are so dry  and this helps prolong my wear time (not by much  but I can at least sit through a movie now). Although a strange feeling that goes against every natural human reaction  I spray this onto open eyes. The directions say that it isn't necessary and that the product will still work if you close your eyes  but it lasts longer for me if I spray onto open eyes. I will definitely re-purchase this. And while this can easily fit in your purse  I do wish they'd make an even smaller one (like pocket size).,Usability
473,I love this machine! and the matching dryer too!<br /><br />Ok to set the record straight. About 4 years ago I fell for the &#34;all about being green front loader&#34;.  I bought an LG Front loader...It has been one of the most miserable 4 years of doing laundry imaginable. I would have never expected such an absolute nightmare. My laundry room has been stacked sky high with clothes that stink so bad that I would have to re-wash them four or five times until they were even wearable. I tried everything  I called the manufacture and begged for guidance! After multiple washings  I would resort to filling the bathtub and soaking all of the dark clothes. I even turned to using bleach - which I haven't used in decades. I couldn't take it anymore. I bought the Speed Queen AYN412 and the matching Dryer. I couldn't be happier with my new SPEED QUEEN I LOVE IT!. I would highly recommend this product.<br /><br />I received my new Speed Queen Washer and Dryer four days ago. It is fantastic! Yes... It looks and acts old-school. (It is true that my neighbor did kind of snicker when she saw it and even more when I told her how happy I was about my new Washer and Dryer) But I love this washer and dryer set. The clothes come out clean smelling and the towels are so fluffy! They look and feel like they have been actually washed. I know right? Imagine that! The clothes come out of the dryer warm and mostly wrinkle free. I can put in as many clothes in this machine as my old LG Front loader with no problem.  I have washed 16 loads of wash in 4 days. I have washed everything from white towels to washable delicate silk and even pantyhose.... Every load - Perfect every time! AND you might want to sit down for this... It takes 50 minutes to wash AND dry a load of laundry. Yep this working mom is very happy about that.  GOODBYE crappy - beat the heck out of the my clothes LG Front loader... Goodbye Forever - we are never never ever getting back together..... P.S. ... As far as the water savings... are you kidding? one load being washed five times only to be sent to a full bathtub doesn't look like any kind of savings to me.vings... are you kidding? one load being washed five times only to be sent to a full bathtub doesn't look like any kind of savings to me.,Product Quality

618,This is the best item I  have purchased for camping. I was recently camping for 2 weeks and this shower was perfect. It allowed me to take a hot shower everyday. I charged it once or twice when I used my car. When charged the pump work well. It never died on me. Some people said it didn't hold a charge. WRONG!!! When I got home a put it in a pot of water to discharge it and it ran for almost 20 minutes.<br />When camping  I never took a 20 minute shower but several 5-6 minute showers almost daily. I definitely recommend this item for all campers.,Usability

The mfg'r should do a little research and provide graphics and instructions for attaching to the major miter saw table brands along with the hood.

Checked the charger with a Volt Meter to be at 12.5 Vdc even with a 10 Ohm power resistor connected to it. Which means that the problem is in the Max A34. Not very easy to take apart as everything is glued with a soft glue gun. Now it is an expensive paper weight. Doubt 1 year warranty is worth anything  but will look into it. Cannot recommend this product based on this experience.,Product Quality

445,I rarely do reviews  but wanted to let people know about the deceptive marketing on this dishwasher.  We did a remodel and due to space constraints needed an 18 inch dishwasher.  We replaced a Kenmore dishwasher rated at 50 db.  The Bosch sounds like a freight train in our kitchen compared to the Kenmore.  We couldn't tell the Kenmore was on  but with the Bosch we can't run it when we are home.  It drowns out the TV and forget about getting any sleep when it is running (the bedroom is on one side of the kitchen and the living room on the other).  Whoever rated this at 46 db must be hard of hearing.<br /><br />The plus side is that it has great features and cleans well.  The only other negative is that door doesn't let you prop it open.  I like to open it a couple inches after it is done to let the dishes dry thoroughly.  The Kenmore would stay in any partially open position  but the Bosch is basically full open or closed and there is no way to adjust the tension on the spring to operate the door.,Product Quality

I work on wind turbines for a living  and the low setting is great for most times when I need light in a dark area/cabinet/junction box  etc. The dial is much easier and faster to operate than a push button  especially when wearing gloves.  It also comes with a clip that's compatible with Petzl hard hats (which we use)  so there's no need to buy an extra headband (or headlamp for that matter).  I can slide this one off my hard hat and onto the soft headband that came with it and get right to work. After pivoting  the light stays secure in that position  and it's ruggedly built. If you use it frequently  it does have a tendency to eat batteries - energizer ultimate lithiums lasted about 2.5 - 3 days of almost continual use.  Other than that  I'm loving this headlamp.,Usability

101,First off  I bought this product on sale for $25 off of Amazon. What a great deal  this bluetooth speaker is LOUD! It's got fair bass levels for the size and price point. Both front and back of the device emit sound  though front is louder. I think this gives it better quality and more range. I use this out by the pool and plan on using for fishing trips and tailgates. The only reason i did not give it 5 stars  when pressing the volume +/- the music stops for a &#34;boop&#34; noise. Also  when powering on  changing modes  or pairing a device  the speaker plays a womens voice that sounds almost comical. It's a little goofy  but at this price point who cares. This speaker is comparable to high end units of the same size  with just slightly less bass.<br /><br />Thanks Amazon!,Usability

I have had buttons destroyed and holes ripped open when the buttons get ripped off.  All they need to do is design a replacement piece and I will get to keep my buttons.,Usability

368,I previously gave this a mediocre review  because it seemed to give me a stomach ache when I made a carrot cake with it. I continued to use it though in smaller amounts. I haven't had the problem since  and it may just be that I at way too much all at once (frosting  etc.)  or else it was the combined ingredients of the cake I ate. I love this stuff. It's so much like sugar and even has the mouth-feel of sugar. I always feel like I'm cheating when I eat it  but I don't get any weight gain or blood sugar surges. I love stevia too  but it's only good in certain things. Swerve is great in everything. I've served it to people without telling them it wasn't sugar  and no one knew the difference. About to order more now. Yum! :P<br /><br />PREVIOUS REVIEW:<br />Love the taste of this stuff  and it would probably be ok in small amounts  but after making a frosted carrot cake using Swerve  I found then it caused quite a bit of nausea. The feeling is similar to what it feels like when you eat way too much sugar. Yet when I tested my blood sugar  it hadn't gone up. Both my boyfriend and I experienced this on both occasions after eating a piece of cake made with this sweetener. The cake taste great  but I won't be buying this again.,Product Quality

332,Great carrier oil. I use it alone to massage my scalp and my boyfriend scalp. I use it on days where my scalp feels too dry/stripped. My boyfriend had horrendous dry scalp (snowflakes all over his shirt and in his hair :/). I massaged this and occasionally tea tree oil in his hair every night for a few days  and it really cleared his flakes up! The tea tree oil helped  but this alone would be fine. I read it jojoba oil/wax is one of the closest substrates to human sebum (which our skin and scalp produce that make it oily). Seems to work that way. His scalp is realllllly dry and his hair is so thick it just kinda lays there (he can go like...5 days without washing his hair). So I apply very liberally throughout his whole scalp. Seems to do the trick! He loves how it makes his hair more manageable and actually &#34;do something&#34; (his words).<br /><br />Really great moisturizer too. I think it'll come in handy in the cold  windy winters here where it is hard to retain moisture. I think it would feel wonderful warmed up and massaged into the scalp or body :).,Product Quality

67,"[[VIDEOID:3bdd17778455ef097fcffb1d018022b6]] There is a good variance in Bluetooth speakers  from physical design  extras in the box and sound quality. Not all speakers are worth your time and money. This little Cube speaker by iGadgitz is a very interesting speaker; it may be little but it has big sound and it works very well. I did find one potential issue when it comes to the range of operation that I will describe below.<br /><br />This is one of the smallest speakers I have seen and used. In spite of its size  it is a solid and hefty little speaker  weighing more than you'd expect. In my mind this is a good sign: it means that there is more to this little speaker than a cheap little speaker and a sub-par receiver. To be honest I was a little skeptical that it would put out good sound when I first saw this speaker. It has pleasantly surprised me (more on that shortly).<br /><br />This speaker pairs and connects very easily. When it is in discoverable mode it identifies itself as \\""""Xquare 2\\"""". I had no issue with it pairing to my phone and once connected it remained connected without issue.<br /><br />The range on this speaker is good and I have been able to carry it from the source to a distance between 20' - 30' before it began to stutter or cut out. I have seen speakers that have more range but the majority of them fall into this threshold. Now  that said I need to mention an issue that came up in testing that should be kept in mind. If the speaker is sitting such that the switch and controls are facing down (that is  the control side is on the flat surface where it is sitting) the range is cut very dramatically. With the speaker sitting that way the range dropped to about 6' before it started cutting out. It did not seem to matter if it was the speaker that was moving away from the source or the other way around.<br /><br />I loaded up some music and played it through this speaker and was pleased with the outcome. The speaker has no problem with playing at higher volume  without distortion or \\""""washing out\\"""". The profile is very good too - the bass is strong and slightly elevated but not overkill  the midrange is very good and the music has depth as a result  and the highs are bright and crisp. For such a small speaker  this one produces better-than-expected sound.<br /><br />This is one of my favorite Bluetooth speakers. It is very small but it has excellent sound and is made very well. The size makes it placeable in areas where other speakers are too bulky to fit. This speaker proves that smaller speakers can have great sound and it's worth its asking price.<br /><br />Disclaimer: I was provided a sample of this product in exchange for a fair  honest and thorough review. Even though I received this product at no cost I have rated and reviewed this product without bias  based solely on my experience with it.er volume  without distortion or \\""""washing out\\"""".

602,3rd season using it. I only fill with water and immediately drain and air dry after every hike. I have experienced no altered taste or smells with this simple care. [Use your Nalgene for flavored water and alcohol!]<br />It's best to fill and pack first for ease in an overnight pack  but can still slide in with a full pack. I've had no issues with suction/water flow. Osprey changed the tube size to 1/4&#34;  which is a good thing as it it fits most quick change valves (mine is cut to allow for direct input from my water pump).<br /><br />The knock - the cap. You're going to have issues and it's only a question of when. The twist cap becomes stuck making it so you have to hold the blue plastic clip in order to securely twist the cap into place. I've found using olive oil (any vegetable oil will do)  on a Q-tip to lubricate the cap between the grey and blue part works well. Probably should avoid a synthetic lubricant like WD-40 unless you're feeling adventurous and are okay with your water smelling like your car's last oil change. This is where the old reservoir has it better - the cap on the old one is highly reliable.<br />Overall  it's good and would be 5-star with a better and more reliable cap (I'd prefer not having to take cautious lubricating measures every time I go on overnight trips).<br /><br />As with all resevoirs and water filtration devices  proper care is necessary. Take 3 minutes to pull it out of your pack immediately  drain  insert a paper towel  and then hang to dry. Unless of course you prefer that old musty scent. I do expect better though of Osprey with regard to the cap considering I'm not the only one who has to deal with this issue.,Product Quality
84,"[[VIDEOID:ca7421903fd1ad5c64ae1dc42a160649]] Earbuds have always been an issue for me. Mine is one of those stereotypical stories -- I can't find a pair that fits my ears well. I've tried so many types of earbuds and most of them give my ear canals some sort of fatigue. It's not that they sound bad  just that keeping them in my ears for more than 10 minutes is painful. The only ones I could tolerate were the Apple EarPods  and I have a love/hate relationship with them. Sure  they sit nicely in my ears  but them being fully open means I lose my music to the crickets of night and pelicans of day. Well  no more! I found the Flare R2A in-ear monitors  and seems my fear of earbuds is over.<br /><br />Disclaimer: This product was provided at a discounted price in exchange for an honest review.<br /><br />The R2s began their life on Kickstarter with a campaign that raised over $170 000. That's quite a lot for IEMs  which are a rather niche market. Flare is a British company that strives for excellence in sound  and hopes that the world can join them in this pursuit. Before the R2s  the company made loudspeakers  so in-ears is a bit of a different industry. I think they did a fine job of things.<br /><br />I listen to a lot of different genres of music  but mostly folk and dream pop lately. To test out the R2s  I listened to hip-hop  jazz  EDM  instrumental guitar and piano  rock  classical  and of course the aforementioned folk. They performed consistently well in every genre. They also look great.<br /><br />First  of course  the sound. These IEMs aren't active noise canceling or anything fancy  which is good because noise canceling often diminishes the sound quality. The R2s are still great for keeping outside noises to a minimum. They use the same plushy foam tips as earplugs  which makes for a comfortable and quiet listening environment. I tried them at work  in the bus  walking down a busy road  and even in a studio while recording. There's absolutely no sound leakage at all  which is great for quiet environments  and none of the quality seems to be lost when the environment is noisy.<br /><br />People sometimes rant about flat response and how it's better than everything else. Those people might be troubled by the R2s. They're warmer than most earbuds  but don't have muddy bass. The main issue with earbuds is always treble: there's way too much of it everywhere. Then Skullcandy wanted to have fun so they started adding a bunch of bass to the mix. Everything above 80Hz seemed to have been lost. The R2s have none of those problems -- highs are crisp  mids cut through well  and the lows of course deliver the much-needed punch  rather than a drone. The responsiveness of everything is very tight.<br /><br />As I said before  everything I listened to with these IEMs sounded wonderful. They revealed details in songs that I didn't know were there  while also being comfortable  affordable  and easy to use. The highs were not overbearing  but pronounced; the high-mids don't clutter the highs at all; the low-mids keep all the bass lines in check; and the lows make sure you remember that the bass drum exists without making you forget about the guitars in the mid-range. That's a great achievement. I really love the way these sound. Everything is balanced. Overall  it's a bit warm  but I would much rather it be warm than sound like tinny old Apple earbuds from the early 2000s  with their mesh and bass-less muddle.<br /><br />On to the design. These things are beautifully minimal  but aren't trying to be artistic  which is nice for a change. The earbuds themselves are black (or whatever color you chose)  and the tips and cable match that. There's also a rectangular machined aluminum box that splits the stereo signal for the left and right channels. It doesn't need to be as big as it is  but it does add some pizzazz to things. Lastly  there's the 3.5mm connector  which on mine is black with two gold stripes running through it.<br /><br />I love the design  but there's one ergonomic inconsistency: The aluminum box. It looks cool  and I can see why the designer would have put it there. However  if you want to use these as a versatile pair of IEMs  you may walk with them once in a while  or just move around a bit. The latter is inevitable  and when you do choose to move around you'll hear some strange thudding sounds. That's the box attempting to defy gravity. Every time I hear this I tell myself it's cool to look at  but doesn't need to be so heavy and certainly doesn't add any special functionality. The heaviness  I suppose  adds value to the IEMs. I would just prefer it wasn't here  especially when I'm using these to perform.<br /><br />While these are \\""""reference\\"""" series -- at least according to the marketing by Flare -- I don't recommend using them for referencing. The R2s don't produce a completely flat sound like Sonys do. They're amazing for listening to  but not necessarily for studio work. I tried mixing a few song using them just for fun  and I noticed that most of my mixes tended to lose the low-mid range on other speakers and headphones simply because the R2s are warm. This characteristic is great when listening to music  but not for mixing/producing it.<br /><br />If you're a musician  you'll find that these are great for monitoring (and thus they are named in-ear monitors). I used them to monitor my vocals and piano while recording an entire song and they worked great. The warmth helps make things less straining on the ears  and there's not so much bass that I get a headache using them after a while. I also used these to monitor my synth and the rest of the band while playing live  and the foam tips isolated the sound very well.<br /><br />It's worth noting that since these are in-ear monitors  there is no microphone. The aluminum block in the middle of the cable just acts as a splitter -- there's no hidden microphone. At first this bugged me  because I would receive a call and forget I couldn't use these headphones to talk. After a while  I just accepted it. There's no reason for IEMs to have a microphone since there's no way for you to use it as a talkback to your band or anything. It also goes against the way that Flare built these  which is to solely focus on recreating sound accurately  not adding more sound. Bottom line: A microphone would have been useful  but there isn't one  and that shouldn't be a deal breaker.<br /><br />Here's the verdict: The R2s made me like earbuds again. I was considering the Shure SE215s  but these reign superior. Once they're in my ears  I don't feel like I need to take them out. They feel at home. Even Apple's EarPods  which \\""""sit\\"""" in my ears nicely  don't make me forget that I'm listening to music through small pieces of plastic in my ears. The R2s do  and they don't look ridiculous like some earbuds. My friend even told me he didn't notice I was wearing them because they're so small.

We had the dishwasher professionally installed  and ran a test cycle. A little more than half way through the cycle  it beeped and gave an error message. I called customer service number and spent two hours in the circle of hell known as voicemail carousel  cut-off  call back  runaround  &#34;try this number instead &#34; and so on. Finally got a repairman out  twice now  and it still has not run through a complete cycle without shutting down with an error message. It has now been 3 weeks since we bought it  and nearly 2 weeks since we had it installed  and we still do not have a working dishwasher. Update: After the backordered parts were installed  it immediately sprung another leak before finishing a load of dishes. More parts have been backordered. It has now been 46 days since I ordered this  and it has never run through a cycle. Electrolux has refused to refund  but Amazon is considering making an exception to their 30 day return policy since the backordered parts kept me waiting.,Customer Service

743,An attractively designed  high quality simple backpack which is light and easily transportable. I bought it because of price to try it  and discovered I like a few more pockets for organisation  so this pack doesn't suit me and I will sell it. But make no mistake  this is a top notch pack  despite it's incredible light weight of 175 grams. Eg  the shoulder straps look like cheap mesh plastic at first glance. But pull it. It's tough and doesn't strech  right? Similarly  none of the stitching gives  and the fabric  is   well  tough.<br /><br />If this type of design suits you  then I'd recommend this pack. If it had 1 or 2 more pockets  I'd keep mine.,Aesthetic Appeal

I cannot believe the terrible comments I have seen written by woman about other companies.  I was so turned off by independent representatives bashing the competition that I turned to Amazon and found a company that I hadn't read anything about and Ordered  three oils  the calming synergy blend being one.

119,I bought this 10 days ago. It was relatively easy to hook up. The auto-calibration took a few tries to get right  but I was pleased with the outcome. The sound was fantastic and really enhanced the viewing experience of my new Sony 4k 70&#34; television.<br /><br />Today it died. I was watching Band of Brothers  and halfway through episode 3 the sound just died. I did my own troubleshooting (I have an advanced degree in electrical engineering) and then called Sony support. They ran me through a few steps  and then escalated me to another department. After being on hold for 40 minutes  the line kicked off and said that the office I was trying to reach was closed for the day.<br /><br />So I am now 10 days into a three thousand dollar investment with Sony  and I am watching a football game with no sound while I type this.<br /><br />My receiver was a poor product. And the support line was awful.<br /><br />I am not happy.,Customer Service
649,I purchased this bag partly based on other reviews  and I must say I am SOOOOO happy that I did!  This bag is fabulous.  I was looking for something that was not the standard  boring black messenger bag  and this is it!  My laptop fits perfectly - it's a Dell 14&#34;.  I was a bit concerned that one reviewer said that he/she had to slice open the laptop sleeve to get the laptop to fit  but my 14&#34; (with extended battery) fits just fine.  This bag is - in the Goldilocks sense - not too big  not too small  but just right.  It is well-designed  with lots of pockets.  It has a strap across the back that I ended up removing because I don't need it (if you ride a bike with the bag  I guess it would be helpful).  The bag is not black  but more like a charcoal color  if that makes a difference.  It can fit a water bottle  but that takes up some of the internal space because of the way the pocket is designed.  This is not a flaw  but something to note if you carry a water bottle and also want to pack more than a laptop and a few folders or a binder.  If you need to carry more than a laptop and maybe one binder or textbook  you will need a bigger bag  but if you're looking for a stylish way to transport your laptop plus a binder or book  this bag is AWESOME.  Super sturdy  well designed  cool pattern  good padding on the laptop sleeve  and some reflective trim for safety  without looking too &#34;sporty&#34;.,Aesthetic Appeal

354,These bands have done wonders for the pain in my husbands knees! The very first time he used them he walked all day without pain- in fact he forgot they were even on! The next day he forgot to put them on and his knees hurt like crazy! They are padded for comfort and have dual Velcro straps for easy and correct tightening without pinching.  He wears  as you can see in the pictures  them below his knees but since they are so adjustable I'm sure they'd work in the area of choice. Perfect size and thickness. Not hot or sweaty. No bulk under his clothing either. Great great product!  Neoprene material- quality construction. Received in exchange for my honest review   Ok so my husband has been wearing these every day and he reported that they WORK!! So much less pain- don't not know why or how but the do. In days he forgets or try's to go without them he can barely walk at the end of the day!! He's had 4 back surgeries and has constant pain down both legs  hip and knees-- these are awesome!

The CR2016 batteries last a long time (if your remember to turn the light off when you're not using it  which some of my grandchildren don't) but they are a bit of a bother to replace  and they are hard to find in retail stores.

I assumed the water dispenser put out chilled water but it doesn't  which sales people didn't even mention. Fridge interior cannot maintain constant temp; items toward rear(like pickles in a jar) have gotten frozen.  Items come out of fridge damp  and shelves are damp.

836,It is very difficult to find decent gloves to fit a woman's hand. All women's gloves I have seen are worthy only of potting plants  not real work. I'd been using a very similar looking  small  men's leather gloves from a big-box store  but the fingers would wear out very quickly.  These have been great so far. I love the extra piece of leather on the first two fingers and the thumb  which is where the others always wore out. There is a little extra padding on the palm and knuckles. The padding may make them a little warmer than typical light-duty gloves. The side of the forefinger is reinforced as well. The construction overall is very good.  The small size fits my hands (which are med/large women's size) well  although it is a tad bit bigger than my usual brand. I am very happy so far and will follow up in time when they are used more.  Update: 5 Months later and they are holding up great. I have been doing a lot of shoveling and working with chicken wire  cement blocks and gravel. They have been used in both wet and dry situations.,Product Quality

445,I rarely do reviews  but wanted to let people know about the deceptive marketing on this dishwasher.  We did a remodel and due to space constraints needed an 18 inch dishwasher.  We replaced a Kenmore dishwasher rated at 50 db.  The Bosch sounds like a freight train in our kitchen compared to the Kenmore.  We couldn't tell the Kenmore was on  but with the Bosch we can't run it when we are home.  It drowns out the TV and forget about getting any sleep when it is running (the bedroom is on one side of the kitchen and the living room on the other).  Whoever rated this at 46 db must be hard of hearing.<br /><br />The plus side is that it has great features and cleans well.  The only other negative is that door doesn't let you prop it open.  I like to open it a couple inches after it is done to let the dishes dry thoroughly.  The Kenmore would stay in any partially open position  but the Bosch is basically full open or closed and there is no way to adjust the tension on the spring to operate the door.,Usability

After trying it out for one day  it was clear the straps are not made for hauling every day items (i.e. a work laptop and plug) as they spread out on the shoulders and make it difficult to walk and carry. After expressing a desire to return the bag  the sellers were not accommodating and really didn't care that it wasn't working for our situation.

920,I really like this tent.  I'm quite happy with it especially for the price.  I set it up once in my yard to learn how to do it before using it at the beach.  It worked great.<br />---Set up is pretty straight forward - simple directions. Picture directions.<br />---I used it at the beach   it was a VERY windy day.  Well  after I set up the tent and had anchored it with the provided pins I noticed it started to lift a little with a big gust  so then I immediately filled the provided sandbags & they nicely weighted the tent down by hanging from the outer part of the tent.  Also  just for fun the kids buried the 2 bottom horizontal poles under sand & rocks the collected and we through some rocks in the bottom inner pocket of the liner.  We also out the cooler down on the bottom horizontal poles to add more weight.  After that:::zero lift  the tent was secured & worked beautifully all day.  Again  it was a very windy beach day.<br />---This tent is nice & light to carry with the shoulder strap - couple pounds only.<br />---Pretty easy dismantle just undo the corner poles then they nicely buckle down to fold.  The rest of the tent folds up rather nicely.  I got 8t back in the bag easily.<br />---This blocked a lot of sun.  It can be shifted around a bit to face the sun to block more sun. I even hung a blanket in the back for more privacy.  I didn't use sunscreen while sitting under it and got no color-I am a red head and can burn in 20 minutes.  But  I was fine under here!<br />---3 of us fit under it no problem.  We lined our towels in it and sat or laid down just like I would normally do at the beach.  Plenty of head room while sitting  but if you want to bring a chair you'd need a low beach chair not a regular chair height or you'd most likely make contact with the top.  You can't stand under this it's too low  but  who stands at the beach?<br />---I love that this tent is simple and WAY more nonchalant than most beach tents that I've seen.  I don't want a huge structure that's florescent and blocks the beach view off and is the size of a room.  No  I want simple  not too much $ and not too showy - and that what this tent is.<br />---The anchor pins are a little short (4 or 5 inches approx) for use in beach sand because the sand is so smooth that they could come out easily - they just don't go deep enough to reach the hard sand at the beach.  So I'll be buying longer pins  like 10 inch size or a foot.,Price

756,The Garage Wall Mounted Bike Rack was easy to install and shipping was super fast!  I bought this to hang my single speed bike which I ride a lot and love the ease of being able to just walk in and store my bike.  My bike is chrome finish steel with red accents and actually I was thinking that on this rack it would look cool actually hanging inside my home rather than relegating it to the garage.  Definitely would recommend and would repurchase for other bikes.,Shipping

778,This is by far one of the best products I have ever had. I would say that I use this beach tent in our yard on a daily basis for afternoon fun in the sun. Yesterday we had some serious winds and it did bend a bit  but that is because I forgot to tie the cords at the top. It was a tad difficult to get open in the wind  but with patience and some sly maneuvers I had it up and locked in in just a few more minutes than usual. It is important to always use the stakes or sandbags to keep the tent from blowing over. All in all I really like this product  and I love their customer service people just as much. Great product!,Product Quality
680,Great product and easy to install.  Purchased for our son who started working beach lifeguard this summer and needed a bike to get around the boardwalk/ocean front.  Rack can be stored easily when not in use and can be installed in minutes.

952,If you use this product on something that has lead paint on it  you will quickly see the swabbed area turn pink or red. You need to be able to test down through all layers of paint  so cutting some away with a knife to get to lower levels is helpful. If there is no lead  you will still see an orange color because the liquid in the product is orange.  Having the test sheet to see the expected color change for a positive result was helpful. There are directions for using the product on a red surface.<br /><br />I tried removing some lead paint with a liquid paint stripper. Retested the bare wood  and it still tested positive. Better to cover it up and seal it in.,Usability

675,This item is outstanding  well made and robust. I use this for separating stainless steel pins from rifle and pistol brass in a wet cleaning process.

905,Can drill about 4 small holes and battery dies.  I don't have another working battery or battery charger currently to 100% troubleshoot the symptoms (which is why I gave 2 stars instead of one); however  after multiple times charging the battery  I consistently get about 60 seconds of operation before the battery dies again.  Would not buy again.,Usability

373,Best general sports tape you can buy.  I have used several other brands but always come back to thie Johnson & Johnson Coach tape because of it's durability and ease of use.  Make sure you but it into 6-9 inch pieces instead of just wrapping a large amount around your ankle  knee  wrist  etc.  That way you can adjust the tightness more accurately and not affect your circulation.,Usability

605,Nice bag. Should have another strap on bottom or something to hold it securely.

973,Unfortunately I had to sharpen the punch's I needed.  The first holes I tried to punch tore the gasket material.  Once I sharpened them it worked ok.

527,We loved it!! Installed very easily  no leaks only remember to purge before hand to remove impurities and air in the filter.  Not having to pay the hefty GE price!! Even if GE is compatible with NFS/ANSI 56 and the Waterfall Filter meets NFS/ANSI 42 and not 56  your county water companies many times have to meet even more stringent health standards than 56.  No worry  we will purchase this filter again. Cheers &amp; good drinking!,Product Quality

Kind of pricy but I happy and have pretty much forgotten what I spent!,Price

56,Bought these headphones a week ago and I love them. These are the most comfortable headphones I've ever owned. Feels so comfortable even listening for many hours. I own a pair of Audio Technica M50x and these for me are much better. They are much more open and a pleasure to listen to any music. I listen to music mostly on my iPad and have a subscription to Tidal premium musi service right now. The clarity of the music is amazing. These headphones also are a great bargain at $108.99 on Amazon. I'm very happy with my purchase.,Product Quality

926,So far  so good.  Bought this for my mother to keep her tires inflated.  Tried other models that blew internal fuses.  No problems this this model so far.<br /><br />It is loud and takes much longer than a commercial model  but it is perfect to keep at home.,Product Quality
438,Worked great until it stopped working.    Twice I've had one of these go out on me.  The first time I ran it without the water turned on (my fault  but it can detect that there's no water nd it keeps running anyway -- what the hell!) and it developed a leak.  I'd had it about 30 days and the company exchanged it for me.  The 2nd time I have been using it correctly with great results for about 1 year.  Then yesterday it started making a different noise than it usually makes -- it sounded like a pump was frozen up - and there was a burning smell.  And it again developed a leak in the bottom.  Disappointed.  It's probably past the warrantee now so I'll likely just have to junk it.  Not sure if I will get another one or not as they all seem to be the same brand available on Amazon so they may all have the same quality issues.,Usability
35,Appears to work just great. Used it to connect my LG 55LB6100 TV (which only had digital optical out and poor speakers in the TV)  to my Onkyo 8255 receiver (RCA inputs).  I connected the FiiO USB power connect into one of the USB ports on the TV so it only powers on when the TV is on; hopefully this will help with issues I read in other reviews with it dying early from being left on and overheating.,Usability

446,Note that this only chills to a low of 51 degrees. I probably would have bought another model had I realized this as I like my white wine in the mid-40s. However it does function well  is a very nice looking refrigerator  and I don't find it to be too loud like some other reviewers (maybe that depends on the surface on where it sits.) Also note that it only fits slim bottles of wine - anything that is a bit larger in circumference on the bottom only fits in a few of the spaces.,Product Quality
114,I really enjoy the the skip and pause functions. Only things I would change is being able to adjust the volume on the speaker itself  and for it to have a better stick  had trouble getting it on the shower. But it was loud enough and easy to use. So ultimately happy with it.,Product Quality

598,I had read reviews extensively before trying this filter. This filter did not work for me. It filters about half a glass of water in 10 minutes or so. Have tried to shake it and reinstall. Thought that an initial clog may eventually get cleared but 30 days down the line it's still just a trickle of water every 15 minutes.<br /><br />This might just be a defective peice but in the last 12 years I have never had such an experience with the original filtrrs. They might be a few bucks more but am going back to them.,Usability

328,This is helpful for those hard to reach spots under a cast.  The spray itself is nice and cool  but the powder smell can be quite strong.  The straw that comes with it is excellent in itself... It's skinny and flexible  and I often use it alone to scratch under the cast.  I assumed that the straw is attached to the nozzle when I bought this  but it is not.  You have to hold the straw to the spray nozzle each time  which is difficult  and you will most likely need help with that part.,Usability
798,This bottle certainly makes hydration more exciting! I mostly drink plain water and it does get boring after a while  so when I saw this product I just had to try it. It makes it easy to add a variety of flavors to your water - the good all-natural way. The bottle itself is very well made  seems sturdy and it arrived well packaged  with no funky smells (a great plus!). I fill the infusing container in the morning and refill it with water multiple times during the day. I usually use cucumbers plus some fragrant like fresh mint leaves  basil or slices of ginger. I haven't tried it with fruit yet but I'm sure it would be delicious. I have received this product at a discounted price in exchange for my honest review  and I warmly recommend it. I hope they make a pitcher version too  as I would love to buy one!,Product Quality
